Text 1
The grammar school boy from Stratford-upon-Avon has landed a scholarlypunch after ground-breaking research showed that Shakespeare does benefichildren's literacy and emotional development. But only if you act him out.

一项开创性的研究表明，莎士比亚确实有益于儿童的读写能力和情感发展，这名来自埃文河畔斯特拉特福的文法学校男孩因此获得了学术上的重击。但前提是你必须把他的戏剧表演出来。

A study found that a “rehearsal room” approach to teaching Shakespearebroadened children's vocabulary and the complexity of their writing as well astheir emotional literacy. “The research shows that the way actors work makes abig difference to the way children use language and also how they think aboutthemselves," Jacqui O'Hanlon of the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), whichcommissioned the study said.

一项研究发现，采用“排练室”教学法教授莎士比亚作品，不仅扩大了儿童的词汇量，提高了写作的复杂性，还提升了他们的情感素养。“研究表明，演员的表演方式对儿童使用语言的方式以及他们如何看待自己有着很大的影响，”委托开展这项研究的皇家莎士比亚剧团 (RSC) 的雅基·奥汉隆 (Jacqui O'Hanlon) 说道。

The randomised control trial involved hundreds of year 5 pupils aged nineand ten-at 45 state primary schools that had not been “previously exposed toRSC pedagogy”. They were split into target and control groups and asked towrite, for example, a message in a bottle as Ferdinand after the shipwreck inThe Tempest. The target group was given a 30-minute drama-based activity toaccompany the passage.

这项随机对照试验涉及45所公立小学的数百名9岁和10岁的五年级学生，这些学校“此前从未接受过RSC的教学法”。他们被分成目标组和对照组，并被要求在《暴风雨》中，以费迪南德的视角，在海难后写下例如“瓶中信”之类的文字。目标组学生被安排了30分钟的戏剧活动来配合文章的阅读。

The peer-reviewed results showed that the target group of pupils drew on awider vocabulary, used words “classed as more sophisticated or rarer”, and wroteat greater length. They also “appear to be more comfortable writing in role...while[control group imagine how they themselves would react to being shipwreckedtarget  group put themselves in the shoes of a literary character and express thatcharacter's emotion’.

同行评审结果显示，目标组学生运用了更广泛的词汇，使用了“被归类为更复杂或更罕见的词汇”，并且写作篇幅更长。他们“似乎更习惯于以角色身份写作……而[对照组]则想象自己遭遇海难时会作何反应，而目标组则设身处地为文学人物着想，并表达该人物的情感”。

The Time to Act study also found that while control pupils relied on “'deserisland clichés” such as palm trees, target pupils were “more expansive [giving] abroader picture of the sky, the sea and the atmospheric conditions”

“行动起来”研究还发现，对照组学生依赖棕榈树等“荒岛陈词滥调”，而目标组学生“更具拓展性，能够更广泛地描绘天空、大海和大气状况”。

O'Hanlon said she had been most surprised by the “emotional literacy thawas evident in the [target] children's writing" and that they were “more resilient intheir writing, more hopeful”. She added: “The emotional understanding was veryevident and it is probably related to the [rehearsal room process] where you areused to trying to imagine your way through. They were comfortable in describingdifferent emotional states and part of what you do in drama is put yourself indifferent shoes.” The study showed the importance of embedding the arts in education, she said.

奥汉隆表示，她最惊讶的是“[目标组]儿童的写作中展现出的情感素养”，以及他们“在写作中更具韧性，也更充满希望”。她补充道：“情感理解非常明显，这可能与[排练室]的练习过程有关，在排练室中，你习惯于尝试想象自己的方式。他们能够自如地描述不同的情绪状态，而你在戏剧中所做的部分工作就是设身处地地为不同的人着想。”她说，这项研究表明了将艺术融入教育的重要性。

But could the results be replicated with any old dramatist? O'Hanlon saidmore research would be needed but suggested that Shakespeare's use of 20,000words, compared with the everyday 2,000 words, gave a “massive expansion oflanguage into children's lives”, which was combined with children “using theiwhole bodies to bring words to life”

但这些结果能在任何一位老剧作家身上复制吗？奥汉隆表示，这还需要更多研究，但她指出，与日常的2000个单词相比，莎士比亚使用了20000个单词，这“极大地扩展了语言在儿童生活中的应用”，同时，孩子们“用他们的整个身体让文字变得生动”。

21. The “rehearsal room” approach requires pupils to
    A. rewrite the lines from Shakespeare
    B. watch RSC actors’performances
    C. play the roles in Shakespeare
    D. study drama under RSC artists
22. The study divided the pupils into two groups to find whether
    A. the change in instruction enhances learning outcomes
    B.expanding vocabulary helps develop reading fluency
    C.emotion affects understanding of sophisticated works
    D.the classroom activity stimulates interest in the arts
23. Control pupils’ reliance on “desert island clichés” shows their
    A. weakness in description
    B. omission of small details

    D. preference for big words
24. What can promote children's emotional literacy according to O'Hanlon?
    A.Writing in an imaginative manner.
    B. Identifying with literary characters.
    C. Drawing inspiration from nature.
    D.Concentrating on real-life situations
25. It can be inferred from the last paragraph that
    A. the new teaching method may work best with ShakespeareB. the language of Shakespeare may be formidable for pupilsCother old dramatists may be included in primary educationD.pupils may be reluctant to work on other old dramatists

I was shocked to learn recently that some scientists want to scale back their research in an effort to decrease carbon emissions. The crisis is here, they said, and we need to cut back on our energy-intensive modelling. At the very least, we need to make our energy use far more sustainable.

最近，我震惊地获悉，一些科学家希望缩减他们的研究，以努力减少碳排放。他们说，危机已经来临，我们需要减少能源密集型模型的制作。至少，我们需要让我们的能源使用更加可持续。

It is unarguable that our laboratories, scientific instruments, rockets and satellites--the tools we scientists need to measure the planet's pulse--demand significant amounts of energy both in their construction and operation. And it is equally true that science's unrelenting appetite for information has caused a mushrooming of energy-intensive data centres around the world. According to the International Energy Agency, these buildings now consume about 1 per cent of the world's electricity.

毋庸置疑，我们的实验室、科学仪器、火箭和卫星--我们科学家测量地球脉搏的工具--在建造和运行过程中都需要大量能源。同样真实的是，科学对信息的不懈追求导致世界各地能源密集型数据中心如雨后春笋般涌现。根据国际能源机构的数据，这些建筑目前消耗了全球约 1% 的电力。

However, this is a price we must pay for understanding the world. How can we inform decision makers about the best ways to bring down carbon emissions if we can't track the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, where it's coming from and who's producing it? The carbon emissions from technological research are well spent: ultimately this research will safeguard the future of our planet. It can be hard for scientists to make the case because our work is complex, often takes place behind closed doors and does not always lend itself to easy interpretation or explanation. But demonstrating the efficacy of science will be crucial if we are to solve humanity's greatest challenges.

然而，这是我们了解世界必须付出的代价。如果我们无法追踪大气中二氧化碳的数量、来源和制造者，我们又如何告知决策者减少碳排放的最佳方法呢？技术研究产生的碳排放是值得的：这项研究最终将保护我们地球的未来。科学家可能很难为自己辩护，因为我们的工作很复杂，经常是闭门造车，并不总能得到简单的解释或说明。但是，如果我们要解决人类面临的最大挑战，展示科学的功效将是至关重要的。

Recognising the hope that science and engineering can bring was the impetus behind the creation of the Millennium Technology Prize, which is now entering its 20th year as a celebration of human ingenuity. One of the past winners, Professor Martin Green from the University of New South Wales, Australia, is the inventor of the Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell technology which is now found in most of the world's solar panels. Thanks to his invention, we have a real chance to decrease the world's carbon emissions.

认识到科学和工程学能够带来的希望，是设立千年技术奖的动力所在。过去的获奖者之一、澳大利亚新南威尔士大学的马丁-格林教授是钝化发射极和后电池技术的发明者，目前世界上大多数太阳能电池板都采用了这种技术。多亏了他的发明，我们才真正有机会减少全球的碳排放量。

Every day, scientists, technologists and engineers are discovering new ways to exploit renewable energy sources and develop techniques not just to use power more intelligently but to power our intelligence. A great example of this is Europe's largest supercomputer, LUMI in Finland, which is astonishingly carbon- negative. Established in an old paper mill, it is powered by a nearby river and its remote heat warms the people who live in the surrounding town of Kajaani.

每天，科学家、技术专家和工程师都在发现开发可再生能源的新方法，并开发出不仅能更智能地使用电力，还能为我们的智慧提供动力的技术。欧洲最大的超级计算机--芬兰的 LUMI 就是一个很好的例子。LUMI 位于一个旧造纸厂内，由附近的一条河流提供电力，其遥远的热量为居住在周围卡亚尼镇的居民提供了温暖。

If the world is to meet its net-zero ambitions, we must think hard about how we can deliver sustainable computing and deliver more LUMIs. 

如果世界要实现净零排放的目标，我们就必须认真思考如何提供可持续的计算，并提供更多的 LUMI。

Ever since taking on Netflix Inc.at its own game,old Hollywood has struggled to turn a profit in streaming,with the likes of Disney+,Peacock and Paramount+ losing billions  of dollars  each year,sparking  concerns  on  Wall  Street  that  the services will never be as profitable as cable once was. But the age of streaming has been a boon for some unintended winners:pirates that use software to rip a film or television show in seconds from legitimate online video platforms and host the titles on their own,illegitimate services,which rake in about $2 billion annually from ads and subscriptions.

自从与Netflix Inc.展开竞争以来，老牌好莱坞一直难以在流媒体领域盈利，Disney+、Peacock和Paramount+等公司每年亏损数十亿美元，这引发了华尔街的担忧，他们担心流媒体服务再也无法像有线电视那样盈利。然而，流媒体时代也为一些意想不到的赢家带来了福音：盗版者使用软件在几秒钟内从合法的在线视频平台上盗版电影或电视节目，并将这些节目托管在自己的非法服务上，这些服务每年通过广告和订阅赚取约20亿美元。

With no video production costs,illegal streaming sites have achieved profit margins approaching 90%,according to the Motion Picture Association(MPA),a trade group representing Hollywood studios that's working to crack down on the thousands of illegal platforms that have cropped up in recent years.

据代表好莱坞电影公司的行业组织美国电影协会（MPA）称，由于没有视频制作成本，非法流媒体网站的利润率接近90%。MPA正致力于打击近年来涌现的数千个非法平台。

Initially the rise of legitimate online businesses such as Netflix actually helped curb digital piracy,which had largely been based on file uploads. But now piracy involving illegal streaming services as well as file-sharing costs the US economy about 30 billion in lost revenue a year and some 250,000 jobs,estimates the US Chamber of Commerce's Global Innovation Policy Center. The global impact is about ​71 billion annually.

最初，Netflix等合法在线业务的兴起实际上有助于遏制数字盗版，而此前的数字盗版主要基于文件上传。但美国商会全球创新政策中心估计，目前涉及非法流媒体服务和文件共享的盗版行为每年给美国经济造成约300亿美元的收入损失，并导致约25万个工作岗位流失。全球每年的损失约为710亿美元。

“The people who are stealing our movies and our television shows and operating piracy sites are not mom and pop operations,"says Charlie Rivkin,chief executive officer of the MPA."This is organized crime."Rivkin joined the MPA in 2017 after the organization failed five years earlier to build consensus between Hollywood and Silicon Valley to win passage of legislation in Congress aimed at stopping online piracy. In 2017 the association formed the Alliance for Creativity and  Entertainment(ACE),an  enforcement  task  force of  about  100 detectives circling the globe to help local authorities arrest streaming pirates.

“窃取我们电影和电视节目并运营盗版网站的人并非夫妻店，”MPA首席执行官查理·里夫金（Charlie Rivkin）表示，“他们是有组织的犯罪。” 五年前，MPA未能促成好莱坞和硅谷达成共识，从而未能在国会通过旨在打击网络盗版的立法。里夫金于2017年加入了MPA。2017年，该协会成立了创意与娱乐联盟（ACE），这是一个由约100名侦探组成的执法工作组，在全球各地协助地方当局逮捕流媒体盗版者。

ACE says it's helped shrink the number of illegal streaming services in North America  to 126,from  more  than  1,400  in  2018,aided  in part by the MPA’s support for a 2020 federal law that made large-scale streaming of copyrighted material a serious crime.

ACE表示，它已帮助北美非法流媒体服务的数量从2018年的1400多个减少到126个，这在一定程度上得益于MPA对2020年一项联邦法律的支持，该法律将大规模流媒体播放受版权保护的内容定为严重犯罪。

Consulting firm Parks Associates predicts  that  legitimate US  streaming services' cumulative loss from piracy since 2022 will reach $113 billion in the next two years."While there is some optimism that emerging countermeasures and best practices may see piracy begin to plateau by 2027,there is no consensus among  stakeholders  as  to when it may begin to decline,"says analyst Steve Hawley.

咨询公司 Parks Associates 预测，自 2022 年以来，美国合法流媒体服务因盗版造成的累计损失将在未来两年内达到 1130 亿美元。“尽管有人乐观地认为，新兴的对策和最佳实践可能会使盗版在 2027 年开始趋于平稳，但利益相关者对于盗版何时开始下降尚未达成共识，”分析师史蒂夫·霍利说。

Text 4
Visit any antiques store and you'll encounter artifacts from the past: photographs, letters, a brochure detailing the Sinclair dinosaur exhibit from the1964-1965 World's Fair, the ephemera of history. Yet these objects aren't truly ephemeral, because they're still here, decades, even centuries later. Why? Because they're tangible.

逛任何一家古董店，你都会看到过去的工艺品：照片、信件、1964-1965 年世界博览会上详细介绍辛克莱恐龙展品的小册子，这些都是历史的短暂见证。然而，这些物品并非真正意义上的短暂，因为它们在几十年甚至几个世纪后依然存在。为什么呢？因为它们是有形的。

Have you pondered the life cycle of intangible formats, digital information,given that those who produce these artifacts seldom make provision for their long-term preservation? For millennia, we've known what we've known due to artifacts that have survived, often despite their original creators’ neglect. The thing itself is the medium that delivers the information, At the time of creation, no attempts were made at intentional preservation, yet analog materials have a chance of surviving and serving as the historical record that biographers, historians and novelists rely on. Libraries and archives have traditionally shouldered the responsibility of organization, preservation, and access to information. One of SR, Ranganathan's foundational Laws of library Science is “Save the time of the reader." Thus, librarians digitize the tangible so that researchers the world over can quickly search and access their holdings. The result is an embarrassment of historical riches, which brings its own needle-and-haystack problems.

你是否思考过无形格式、数字信息的生命周期，因为生产这些艺术品的人很少为它们的长期保存做准备？千百年来，我们之所以知道我们所知道的一切，都是因为这些人工制品得以保存下来，尽管最初的创造者往往忽视了这些人工制品。文物本身就是传递信息的媒介，在被创造出来的时候，没有人试图刻意保存，然而模拟材料却有机会存活下来，成为传记作家、历史学家和小说家所依赖的历史记录。图书馆和档案馆历来承担着组织、保存和获取信息的责任。SR, Ranganathan 的图书馆学基本法则之一是 “节约读者的时间”。因此，图书馆员将有形资料数字化，以便世界各地的研究人员能够快速搜索和获取他们所持有的资料。这样做的结果是，历史财富多得令人尴尬，同时也带来了针尖对麦芒的问题。

Librarians’ selfless devotion can act against us when users point to universality of access by holding up a cell phone and saying, “it's all in here” as evidence that libraries are less vital for researchers today. Yet how was that universal it! of access made possible and, perhaps more importantly, how is it maintained 'Who curates what is preserved? When it comes to born-digital information, the terrifying answer can be: if not librarians and archivists,then no one. Digital information requires a great deal more care than analog.

当用户举起手机说 “都在这里 ”时，图书馆员的无私奉献可能会对我们不利。然而，这种普遍获取是如何实现的？也许更重要的是，它是如何维持的？说到天生的数字信息，可怕的答案可能是：如果不是图书馆员和档案管理员，那就没有人了。与模拟信息相比，数字信息需要更多的关注。

Even when a digital object is preserved, it may only be the carrier that's saved not the information itself. As technology advances and a format becomes obsolete the object is useless. Have you ever stared helplessly at a ZIP disk, thinking: how do I get the files off this? Without constant migration of digital assets, a nightmare about the foreseeable future is what keeps historians up at nioht: a historical record that abruptly stops when digital replaces analog.

即使保存了数字对象，保存的也可能只是载体，而不是信息本身。随着技术的进步，格式变得过时，对象也就失去了作用。你是否曾经无助地盯着 ZIP 磁盘，想着：我该如何把文件从这上面取下来？如果没有数字资产的不断迁移，一个关于可预见未来的噩梦就会让历史学家夜不能寐：当数字取代模拟时，历史记录就会戛然而止。

As a librarian whose day job revolves around special collections and digital assets, I share the night terrors of historians, and I'd be lying if I said a comprehensive preservation solution currently exists, Yet researchers can take some comfort in the fact that there are a multitude of librarians devoted to discovering, organizing, and preserving digital information for researchers current and future. Librarians are uniquely positioned to understand how end users seek and use information. Thus we play an integral role in identifying, preserving, and providing accessibility to digital artifacts so that, while future researchers may find the digital realm a challenging place to ply their trade, they won't find it an impossible one.

作为一名图书馆员，我的日常工作与特藏和数字资产有关，我与历史学家一样夜不能寐，如果我说目前已经有了全面的保存解决方案，那是骗人的。图书馆员在了解最终用户如何寻找和使用信息方面具有得天独厚的优势。因此，我们在识别、保存和提供数字文物的可访问性方面发挥着不可或缺的作用，这样，尽管未来的研究人员可能会发现数字领域是一个充满挑战的地方，但他们不会发现这是一个不可能的地方。

U.S. customers historically tipped people they assumed were earning most of their income via tips, such as restaurant servers earning less than the minimum wage. In the early 2010s, a wide range of businesses started processing purchases with iPads and other digital payment systems. These systems often prompted customers to tip for services that were not previously tipped.

美国顾客历来会给他们认为大部分收入来自小费的人支付小费，例如收入低于最低工资标准的餐厅服务员。2010 年代初，许多企业开始使用 iPad 和其他数字支付系统处理消费。这些系统通常会促使顾客为以前没有小费的服务支付小费。

Today's tip requests are often not connected to the salary and service norms that used to determine when and how people tip. Customers in the past nearly always paid tips after receiving a service, such as at the conclusion of a restaurant meal, after getting a haircut or once a pizza was delivered. That timing could reward high-quality service and give workers an incentive to provide it It's becoming more common for tips to be requested beforehand. And newtipping technology may even automatically add tips.

如今的小费要求往往与过去决定人们何时以及如何支付小费的工资和服务规范无关。过去，顾客几乎总是在接受服务后支付小费，如在餐厅用餐结束后、理发后或披萨送达后。这种时间安排可以奖励优质服务，并激励员工提供优质服务。新的小费技术甚至可以自动添加小费。

The prevalence of digital payment devices has made it easier to ask customers for a tip. That helps explain why tip requests are creeping into new kinds of services, Customers now routinely see menus of suggested default options-often well above 20% of what they owe. The amounts have risen from 10% or less in the 1950s to 15% around the year 2000 to 20% or higher today. This increase is sometimes called tip flation-the expectation of ever-higher tip amounts.

数字支付设备的普及使得向顾客索要小费变得更加容易。这就解释了为什么小费要求正逐渐渗透到新型服务中，顾客现在经常会看到建议的默认选项菜单--通常远高于他们所欠金额的 20%。从 20 世纪 50 年代的 10%或更少，到 2000 年左右的 15%，再到如今的 20%或更高。这种增长有时被称为 “小费浮动”--对小费数额越来越高的预期。

Tipping has always been a vital source of income for workers in historically tipped services, like restaurants, where the tipped minimum wage can be as low as US$2.13 an hour. Tip creep and tip flation are now further supplementing the income of many low-wage service workers.

小费一直是餐馆等历来有小费的服务行业工人的重要收入来源，在这些行业，小费最低工资可低至每小时 2.13 美元。现在，小费攀升和小费浮动进一步补充了许多低工资服务业工人的收入。

Notably, tipping primarily benefits some of these workers, such as waiters but not others, such as cooks and dishwashers. To ensure that all employees were paid fair wages, some restaurants banned tipping and increased prices, but this movement toward no-tipping services has largely fizzled out.

值得注意的是，小费主要惠及其中一些工人，如服务员，而不是其他工人，如厨师和洗碗工。为了确保所有员工都能获得合理的工资，一些餐厅禁止支付小费，并提高了价格，但这种无小费服务运动已基本消退。

So, to increase employee wages without raising prices, more employers are succumbing to the temptations of tip creep and tip flation. However, many customers are frustrated because they feel they are being asked for too high of a tip, too often. And, as our research emphasizes, tipping now seems to be more coercive, less generous and often completely disassociated from service quality.

因此，为了在不提高价格的情况下增加员工工资，越来越多的雇主开始屈服于小费攀升和小费浮动的诱惑。然而，许多顾客感到沮丧，因为他们觉得被索要的小费太高、太频繁。而且，正如我们的研究强调的那样，现在的小费似乎更具胁迫性，不那么慷慨，而且往往与服务质量完全脱节。

When it was established, the National Health Service (NHS) was visionary. offering high-quality, timely care to meet the dominant needs of the population iserved, Nearly 75 years on, with the UK facing very different health challenges, it is clear that the model is out of date.

英国国民医疗服务体系（NHS）在建立之初就具有远见卓识，它提供优质、及时的医疗服务，以满足所服务人群的主要需求，但将近 75 年过去了，英国面临着截然不同的健康挑战，这种模式显然已经过时。

From life expectancy to cancer and infant mortality rates, we are lagging behind many of our peers. With more than 6.8 million on waitlists, healthcare is becoming increasingly inaccessible for those who cannot opt to pay for private treatment; and the cost of providing healthcare is increasingly squeezing out investment in other public services. As demand for healthcare continues to grow. pressures on the workforce-which is already near breaking point--will only become more acute.

从预期寿命到癌症和婴儿死亡率，我们都落后于许多同行。目前有 680 多万人在候诊名单上，对于那些无法选择支付私人治疗费用的人来说，越来越难以获得医疗保健服务；而提供医疗保健服务的成本正日益挤压对其他公共服务的投资。随着医疗需求的持续增长，已经接近崩溃边缘的劳动力压力只会变得更加严峻。

Many of the answers to the crisis in health and care are well rehearsed We need to be much better at reducing and diverting demand on health services, rather than simply managing it. Much more needs to be invested in communities and primary care to reduce our reliance on hospitals. And capacity in social care needs to be greater, to support the growing number of people living with long-term conditions.

我们需要更好地减少和转移对医疗服务的需求，而不是简单地进行管理。我们需要加大对社区和初级医疗的投入，以减少对医院的依赖。我们还需要提高社会医疗服务的能力，为越来越多的长期病患者提供支持。

Yet despite two decades of strategies and a number of major health reforms we have failed to make meaningful progress on any of these aims. That is why the Reform think tank is launching a new programme of work entitled “Reimagining health”, supported by ten former health ministers. Together, we are calling for a much more open and honest conversation about the future of health in the UK, and an “'urgent rethink" of the hospital-centric model we retain.

然而，尽管我们制定了二十年的战略并进行了一系列重大的卫生改革，但我们仍未能在这些目标上取得有意义的进展。正因如此，改革智库在十位前卫生部长的支持下，启动了一项名为 “重新构想健康 ”的新工作计划。我们共同呼吁对英国卫生事业的未来进行更加开放和坦诚的对话，并对我们所保留的以医院为中心的模式进行 “紧急反思”。

This must begin with the question of how we maximise the health of the nation, rather than “fix” the NHS. It is estimated, for example, that healthcare accounts for only about 20% of health outcomes. Much more important are the places we live, work and socialise-yet there is no clear cross-government strategy for improving these social determinants of health. Worse, when policies like the national obesity strategy are scrapped, taxpayers are left with the heavsprice tag of treating the illnesses. like diabetes. that result.

这必须从我们如何最大限度地提高国民健康水平的问题开始，而不是 “修复 ”NHS。例如，据估计，医疗保健只占健康结果的 20%左右。更重要的是我们生活、工作和社交的地方--然而，目前还没有明确的跨政府战略来改善这些决定健康的社会因素。更糟糕的是，当国家肥胖症战略等政策被废除时，纳税人却要承担治疗糖尿病等疾病的高昂费用。

Reform wants to ask how power and resources should be distributed in unhealth system, What health functions should remain at the centre, and what should be given to local leaders, often responsible for services that create health, and with a much better understanding of the needs of their populations?

改革要问的是，在非卫生系统中，权力和资源应如何分配？哪些卫生职能应保留在中心，哪些应交给地方领导人？

Heat action plans, or HAPs, have been proliferating in India in the past few years. In general, an HAP spells out when and how officials should issue heat warnings and alert hospitals and other institutions. Nagpur's plan, for instance calls for hospitals to set aside “cold wards” in the summer for treating heat stroke patients, and advises builders to give construction laborers a break from work on very hot days.

过去几年中，高温行动计划（HAPs）在印度如雨后春笋般涌现。一般来说，高温行动计划规定了官员应在何时以及如何发布高温预警，并向医院和其他机构发出警报。例如，那格浦尔的计划要求医院在夏季为治疗中暑病人留出 “冷藏室”，并建议建筑商在酷热天让建筑工人休息。

But implementation of existing HAPs has been uneven, according to a report from the Center for Policy Research, Many lack adequate funding, it found. And their triggering thresholds often are not customized to the local climate. In some areas, high daytime temperatures alone might serve as an adequate triggel for alerts. But in other places, night time temperatures or humidity might be as important a gauge of risk as daytime highs.

但根据政策研究中心的一份报告，现有 HAPs 的实施情况参差不齐。而且，它们的触发阈值往往不适合当地气候。在某些地区，仅白天的高温就足以触发警报。但在其他地方，夜间温度或湿度可能与白天的高温一样重要，都是衡量风险的标准。

Mumbai's April heat stroke deaths highlighted the need for more nuanced and localized warnings, researchers say. That day's high temperature of roughly36'C was 1'C shy of the heat wave alert threshold for coastal cities set by national meteorological authorities. But the effects of the heat were amplified by humidity-an often neglected factor in heat alert systems-and the lack of shade at the late-morning outdoor ceremony.

研究人员说，孟买 4 月份发生的中暑死亡事件突出表明，有必要发布更加细致和本地化的预警。当天的最高气温约为 36 摄氏度，距离国家气象部门为沿海城市设定的热浪警报阈值还差 1 摄氏度。但是，湿度--一个在高温预警系统中经常被忽视的因素--以及深夜户外仪式上缺少遮阳物，放大了高温的影响。

To help improve HAPs, urban planner Kotharkar's team is working on a model plan that outlines best practices and could be adapted to local conditions. Among other things, she says, all cities should create a vulnerability map to help focus responses on the populations most at risk.

为了帮助改进 HAPs，城市规划师 Kotharkar 的团队正在制定一项示范计划，该计划概述了最佳实践，并可根据当地情况进行调整。她说，除其他事项外，所有城市都应绘制脆弱性地图，以帮助将应对措施集中在风险最大的人群上。

Such mapping doesn't need to be complex, Kotharkar says.“A useful map can be created by looking at even a few key parameters." For example, neighborhood. with a large elderly population or informal dwellings that cope poorly with heat could get special warnings or be bolstered with cooling centers. The Nagpurproject has already created a risk and vulnerability map, which enabled Kotharkar to tell officials which neighborhoods to focus on in the event of a heat wave this summer.

科塔卡尔说，绘制这样的地图并不需要很复杂。“只要查看几个关键参数，就能绘制出有用的地图”。例如，对于老年人口较多的社区或应对高温能力较差的非正规住宅，可以发出特别警告，或设立降温中心。那格浦尔项目已经绘制了一张风险和脆弱性地图，这让科塔卡尔能够告诉官员们，如果今年夏天出现热浪，应该重点关注哪些社区。

HAPs shouldn't just include short-term emergency responses, researchers say, but also recommend medium- to long-term measures that could make communities cooler. In Nagpur, for example, Kotharkar's team has been able to advise city officials about where to plant trees to provide shade. HAPs could also guide efforts to retrofit homes or modify building regulations. “Reducing deaths in an emergency is good target to have, but it's the lowest target,” says climate researcher Chandni Singh.

研究人员说，HAPs 不应只包括短期应急措施，还应建议中长期措施，使社区更加凉爽。例如，在那格浦尔，科塔卡尔的团队已经能够建议市政官员在哪里植树造林，以提供树荫。HAPs 还能为改造房屋或修改建筑法规提供指导。“气候研究员钱德尼-辛格（Chandni Singh）说：”减少紧急情况下的死亡人数是一个很好的目标，但这是最低的目标。

Navigating beyond the organised pavements and parks of our urban spacesdesire paths are the unofficial footprints of a community, revealing the unspokenpreferences, shared shortcuts and collective choices of humans. Often appearing astrodden dirt tracks through otherwise neat green spaces, these routes of collectivedisobedience cut corners, bisect lawns and cross hills, representing the natural capability of people (and animals) to go from point A to point B most effectively.

在城市空间有组织的人行道和公园之外，欲望之路是一个社区的非官方足迹，揭示了人类心照不宣的偏好、共同的捷径和集体的选择。这些集体不服从的路线往往是在原本整洁的绿地上留下的坑坑洼洼的泥土小路，它们切角、穿过草坪、越过山丘，代表了人类（和动物）最有效地从 A 点到 B 点的自然能力。

Urban planners interpret desire paths as more than just convenient shortcuts:they offer valuable insights into the dynamics between planning and behaviour.Ohio State University allowed its students to navigate the Oval, a lawn in thecentre of campus, freely, then proceeded to pave the desire paths, creating a webof effective routes students had established.

俄亥俄州立大学允许学生在校园中心的椭圆形草坪上自由穿行，然后铺设欲望之路，形成了一个由学生建立的有效路线网络。

Yet, reluctance persists among other planners to integrate desire paths intoformal plans, citing concerns about safety, enyironmental impact,or primarily aesthetics. A Reddit webpage devoted to the phenomenon, boasting nearly 50,000members, showcases images of local desire paths adorned with signs instructingpedestrians to adhere to designated walkways, underscoring the rebellious nature inherent in these human-made tracks. This clash highlights an ongoing struggle between the organic, user-driven evolution of public spaces and the desire for ayisually curated and controlled urban environment.

然而，其他规划者仍不愿将欲望之路纳入正式规划，理由是担心安全、环境影响或主要是美观问题。Reddit 上有一个专门讨论这一现象的网页，拥有近 5 万名会员，该网页展示了当地欲望之路的图片，图片上贴着指示行人遵守指定人行道的标语，凸显了这些人造轨道固有的反叛性质。这种冲突凸显了公共空间有机的、由用户驱动的演变与人们对人工规划和控制的城市环境的渴望之间持续不断的斗争。

The Wickquasgeck Trail is an example of a historical desire path, created byNative Americans to cross the forests of Manhattan and move between settlementsquickly. This trail, when Dutch colonists arrived, was widened and made into oneof the main trade roads across the island, known at the time as de Heere Straat.or Gentlemen's Street. Following the British assumption of control in New York.the street was renamed Broadway. Notably, Broadway stands out as one of thefew areas in NYC that defies the grid-based system applied to the rest of the citycutting a diagonal across parts of the city.

Wickquasgeck 步道是历史上欲望之路的一个例子，由美国土著人创建，用于穿越曼哈顿的森林并在定居点之间快速移动。当荷兰殖民者来到这里时，这条小路被拓宽，成为横跨全岛的主要贸易道路之一，当时被称为 de Heere Straat 或绅士街。英国控制纽约后，这条街改名为百老汇。值得注意的是，百老汇是纽约市为数不多的几个区域之一，它打破了纽约市其他区域采用的网格系统，以对角线的形式横穿纽约市的部分区域。

In online spaces, desire paths have sparked a fascination that can approachobsession, with the Reddit page serving as a hub. Contributors offer a wide arrayof stories, from little-known new shortcuts to long-established alternate routes.Animal desire paths, such as ducks forging trails through frozen ponds or dogscarving direct routes in gardens, highlight the adaptability of these trails in bothhuman and animal experiences. As desire paths criss-cross through both physicaland virtual landscapes, they stand as a proof of the collective insistence on forgingunconventional routes and embracing the spirit of communal choice.

在网络空间，“欲望之路 ”引发了近乎疯狂的关注，Reddit 网页就是其中的一个中心。动物的欲望之路，如鸭子在结冰的池塘中开辟小径，或狗在花园中开辟直达路线，突出了这些路径在人类和动物体验中的适应性。欲望之路纵横交错，既有物理景观，也有虚拟景观，它们证明了人们对开辟非常规路线和拥抱共同选择精神的集体坚持。

Innovation and research have relied on public participation in science for centuries. It was a musician who discovered the planet Uranus in the 18th century by making his own telescope with mirrors composed of copper and tin. Recent decades have seen science move into a convention where engagement in the subject can only be done through institutions such as a university. Citizen science provides an opportunity for greater public engagement and the democratisation of science.

几个世纪以来，创新和研究一直依赖于公众对科学的参与。18 世纪，一位音乐家用铜和锡组成的镜子自制望远镜，发现了天王星。近几十年来，科学进入了一个只能通过大学等机构来参与的时代。公民科学为更多的公众参与和科学民主化提供了机会。

In the information era, large data sets, small teams and financial restrictions have slowed scientific process. But by utilising the natural curiosity of the general public it is possible to overcome many of these challenges by engaging non-scientists directly in the research process. Anyone can be a citizen scientist,regardless of age, nationality or academic experience. You don’t even need any formal training, just an inquisitive mind and the enthusiasm to join one of the thousands of citizen science projects to generate new knowledge and the means to understand a genuine scientific outcome.

在信息时代，庞大的数据集、小型团队和资金限制阻碍了科学进程。但是，通过利用公众天生的好奇心，让非科学家直接参与研究过程，就有可能克服其中的许多挑战。任何人都可以成为公民科学家，无论其年龄、国籍或学术经验如何。你甚至不需要接受任何正规培训，只要有一颗好奇的心和满腔热情，就可以加入数以千计的公民科学项目，创造新知识，了解真正的科学成果。

Scientists have employed a variety of ways to engage the general public in their research, such as making data analysis into an online game or sample collection into a smartphone application. They’ve implored citizens to help with bug counting and categorising cancer cells, and even identifying distant galaxies.

科学家们采用了各种方式让公众参与他们的研究，比如将数据分析制作成网络游戏，或将样本采集制作成智能手机应用程序。他们还恳求市民帮助进行虫子计数和癌细胞分类，甚至识别遥远的星系。

This form of accessible science means that great minds are able to join the raceto create and develop projects with the potential to change the world. A citizenscience-based approach can extend the field ofvision and include different ideas anddifferent brains to problem-solve and create, making innovation faster and moreeffective.

这种无障碍的科学形式意味着伟大的头脑能够加入到创造和开发有可能改变世界的项目的竞赛中来。以公民科学为基础的方法可以扩展视野，让不同的想法和不同的大脑来解决问题和进行创造，从而使创新更快、更有效。

The rise of citizen science has grown alongside the rise of do-it-yourself biology laboratories around the world. These groups of people are part of a rapidly expanding biotechnological social movement of cities scientists and professional scientists seeking to take discovery out of institutions and put it into the hands of anyone with the enthusiasm.

公民科学的兴起与世界各地 “自己动手做 ”生物实验室的兴起同步增长。这些群体是迅速扩大的生物技术社会运动的一部分，由城市科学家和专业科学家组成，旨在将发现从机构中解放出来，让任何有热情的人都能参与其中。

There are around 40 official do-it-yourself biology centres across the globe in locations including Paris, London, Sydney, and Tel Aviv. They pool resources,collaborate, think outside the box, and find solutions and ways around obstacles to explore science for the sake of science without the traditional boundaries of working inside a formal setting. So is it time to take the Petri dish out of the laboratory and into the garage?

全球约有 40 个官方 “自己动手 ”生物学中心，分布在巴黎、伦敦、悉尼和特拉维夫等地。这些中心汇集资源、相互协作、打破常规思维、寻找解决方案和绕过障碍的方法，为科学而探索科学，摆脱了在正规环境中工作的传统束缚。那么，是时候把培养皿从实验室搬到车库里了吗？

[A]这些工具可以帮助你赢得每一场争论——并非指毫无意义地击败对手，而是更深入地了解造成人们分歧的问题。了解他们为何不同意我们的观点，并学会与他们沟通和合作。如果我们重新调整对争论的看法——从口头争吵或网球比赛转变为理性的交流，通过这种交流，我们都能获得相互尊重和理解——那么我们就能改变“赢得”争论的本质。

[B]Of course,many discussions are not  so  successful.Still,we need to be  careful not to  accuse  opponents of  bad  arguments too quickly.We need to learn how to evaluate them properly.A large part of evaluation is calling out bad arguments, but we also need to admit good arguments by opponents and to apply the same critical  standards  to  ourselves.Humility  requires  you to recognize weakness in your own arguments and sometimes also to accept reasons on the opposite side.

[B]当然，很多讨论并非如此成功。然而，我们需要注意，不要过快地指责对手的论点不充分。我们需要学习如何正确地评估他们。评估的很大一部分在于指出对方的论点不充分，但我们也需要承认对方的论点充分，并将同样的批判标准应用于自己。谦逊要求你认识到自身论点的弱点，有时也需要接受对方的观点。

[C]None of these will be easy but you can  start  even if others refuse to.Next time you state your position,formulate an argument for what you claim and honestly ask yourself  whether  your argument is any good.Next time you talk with someone who takes a  stand,ask them to  give you  a reason  for their view.Spell out their argument fully and charitably.Assess its strength impartially.Raise objections and listen carefully to their replies.

[C] 这些都不容易，但即使别人拒绝，你也可以开始。下次你陈述立场时，要为你的主张构建论据，并诚实地问问自己，你的论点是否有道理。下次你与有立场的人交谈时，请他们给出他们观点的理由。充分而宽容地阐述他们的论点。公正地评估其力度。提出反对意见，并仔细倾听他们的回应。

D] Carnegie would be right if arguments were fights,which is how we often think of them.Like physical  fights,verbal  fights  can  leave  both  sides  bloodied.Even when you win,you end up no better off.Your prospects would be almost as dismal if  arguments were even  just  competitions -like,say,tennis games.Pairs of opponents hit the ball back and forth until one winner emerges from all who entered.Everybody else loses.This kind of thinking is why so many people try to avoid arguments,especially about politics and religion.

D] 如果争论是打架——我们通常就是这样看待争论的——那么卡内基是对的。就像肢体冲突一样，言语冲突会让双方伤痕累累。即使你赢了，最终也没有任何好处。如果争论只是一场比赛——比如网球比赛——你的前景几乎同样黯淡。一对对的对手来回击球，直到所有参赛者中决出胜者。其他人都是输家。这种想法就是为什么这么多人试图避免争论，尤其是在政治和宗教问题上。

E In his 1936 work How to Win Friends and Influence People,Dale Carnegie wrote: "There is only one way...to get the best of an argument - and that is to avoid it." This  aversion  to  arguments  is common,but it depends on a  mistaken view of arguments that causes profound problems  for our personal  and  social  lives-and in many ways misses the point of arguing in the first place.

E 戴尔·卡耐基在其1936年出版的著作《如何赢得朋友和影响他人》中写道：“要想在争论中占上风，只有一种方法——那就是避免争论。” 这种对争论的厌恶很常见，但它源于一种对争论的错误看法，这种看法会给我们的个人和社会生活带来深远的问题，而且在很多方面都忽略了争论的初衷。

F]These views  of arguments  also undermine  reason.If you  see  a  conversation  as  a fight  or  competition,you  can  win  by  cheating  as  long  as  you  don't  get caught. You  will be  happy  to  convince  people  with  bad  arguments.You  can  call  their views stupid,or joke about how ignorant they are.None of these tricks will help you  understand  them,their  positions  or  the  issues  that  divide  you,but  they  can help  you win-in one way.

F] 这种对争论的看法也会破坏理性。如果你把谈话看作一场争斗或竞争，那么只要不被抓住，你就可以作弊取胜。你会乐于用糟糕的论点说服别人。你可以称他们的观点愚蠢，或者开玩笑说他们多么无知。这些技巧都无法帮助你理解他们、他们的立场或你们之间分歧的问题，但它们可以帮助你赢得胜利——在某种程度上。

[G]There  is  a  better  way to win arguments. Imagine that you favor increasing the minimum wage in our state,and I do not.If you yell,“Yes,"and  I yell,"No,” neither  of us  learns  anything. We neither understand nor respect  each  other,and we have no basis for compromise or cooperation. In contrast,suppose you give a reasonable  argument:that  full-time  workers  should  not  have  to  live  in  poverty. Then I  counter with  another reasonable  argument:that  a higher minimum wage will  force businesses  to  employ  fewer people  for  less  time. Now  we  can understand each other's positions and recognize our shared values,since we both care about needy workers.

[G] 有一种更好的方法来赢得争论。想象一下，你赞成提高我们州的最低工资标准，而我反对。如果你喊“赞成”，我喊“反对”，我们谁也得不到任何好处。我们既不理解也不尊重对方，也没有妥协或合作的基础。相反，假设你提出一个合理的论点：全职工作者不应该生活在贫困之中。然后我又提出另一个合理的论点：提高最低工资标准将迫使企业减少员工数量，缩短工作时间。现在，我们能够理解彼此的立场，并认识到我们共同的价值观，因为我们都关心贫困的工人。

H.A butterfly takes off so quickly it is still impossible to react quickly enough to capture that take-off but if he half-presses the shutter,the camera saves the 70 previous frames before the moment he actually takes the picture.“It's time travel,so I don't miss the moment of take-off,"he says. After he's captured the butterfly taking off,he layers 10 to 15 frames together in Photoshop.



Writing an essay on **"Views on AI"** requires clear structuring and a balanced perspective, whether you're positive, skeptical, or neutral about AI. Here's a detailed guide on how to approach this topic, including how to begin, organize your ideas, and end the essay. I'll also provide useful expressions for an exam setting.

------

### 1. **How to Begin** (Introduction)

- **Hook**: Start with a general statement to engage the reader. This could be a quote, a surprising fact, or a rhetorical question about AI.
- **Context**: Briefly introduce AI—what it is and its growing role in society.
- **Thesis Statement**: Provide a clear viewpoint, outlining what the essay will discuss (e.g., the benefits and challenges of AI, its future implications, etc.).

#### Example Introduction:

*"Artificial Intelligence has become a buzzword in nearly every sector, from healthcare to finance. With AI's rapid growth and integration into our daily lives, its implications are far-reaching. In this essay, I will explore both the positive and negative aspects of AI, discussing its impact on human life, employment, and privacy."*

------

### 2. **How to Write & What to Write in the Components?**

#### **Body Paragraph 1**: **Benefits of AI**

- **Topic Sentence**: Introduce the positive aspects of AI.
- **Explanation**: Expand on how AI benefits society (e.g., automation, efficiency, medical breakthroughs).
- **Examples**: Provide real-world examples (e.g., AI in medical diagnosis, AI helping in data analysis).
- **Link Back**: Conclude the paragraph by emphasizing how these benefits enhance human life.

#### Example:

"AI's ability to process vast amounts of data in seconds can revolutionize various industries. For instance, in healthcare, AI-powered tools assist doctors in diagnosing diseases faster and more accurately, which ultimately saves lives. In business, AI-driven analytics can streamline decision-making, reducing costs and improving efficiency. Such benefits show how AI can greatly enhance human capabilities and productivity."

------

#### **Body Paragraph 2**: **Challenges and Risks of AI**

- **Topic Sentence**: Introduce the risks and negative aspects of AI.
- **Explanation**: Talk about ethical concerns, job displacement, security issues, etc.
- **Examples**: Mention examples like AI bias, unemployment due to automation, or privacy concerns.
- **Link Back**: Summarize the risks and state that these must be managed properly.

#### Example:

"Despite its potential, AI raises several concerns. One major issue is job displacement; as AI systems automate tasks traditionally performed by humans, many workers may lose their livelihoods, especially in sectors like manufacturing and retail. Furthermore, AI systems often inherit the biases of their creators, which could lead to discrimination in areas like hiring or law enforcement. These risks highlight the need for regulation and careful implementation."

------

#### **Body Paragraph 3**: **The Future of AI**

- **Topic Sentence**: Discuss the future of AI, balancing optimism and caution.
- **Explanation**: Explain how AI will continue to evolve, the need for ethical guidelines, and the potential for collaboration between humans and AI.
- **Examples**: Touch on AI in emerging fields like self-driving cars, AI ethics committees, or AI-assisted research.
- **Link Back**: Conclude by stressing that with proper management, AI's potential is limitless.

#### Example:

"The future of AI promises even greater advances. Self-driving cars, for example, are expected to revolutionize transportation, reducing accidents and improving traffic efficiency. However, as AI technology becomes more integrated into our lives, ethical frameworks must be established to guide its development. Governments and organizations should collaborate to ensure AI serves humanity’s best interests, balancing innovation with safety."

------

### 3. **How to End? (Conclusion)**

- **Restate the Thesis**: Reaffirm your position and main points.
- **Summarize the Key Points**: Briefly summarize the benefits, challenges, and future of AI.
- **Final Thought**: End with a forward-thinking statement or a call for action, inviting further reflection or consideration on AI’s impact.

#### Example Conclusion:

"In conclusion, while AI presents incredible opportunities for improving efficiency and solving complex problems, it also poses significant risks that must be addressed. Its future will depend on how carefully we manage its development and integrate it into our society. As we continue to innovate, we must ensure that AI is developed ethically and responsibly, ensuring its benefits are felt by all."

##### Text

seeing at `./log/11_text.md` 高级英语—Assignment—text

> based on text above, please answer questions below:
>
> 1. what is nature, proportion, pattern of behaviour and effect of grade-three, grade-two, grade-one seperately
> 2. summarize the key points, main ideas, and important details of different levels of thinking
> 3. paraphrase text and use easy to understand words as far as possible





##### 1. Grade-Three, Grade-Two, Grade-One Thinking: Nature, Proportion, Behavior, and Effect  

###### Grade-Three Thinking  
- **Nature**:  
  - Based on **emotion, prejudice, and hypocrisy**, not true reasoning. It mimics thought but is actually instinctive or socially conditioned.  
- **Proportion**:  
  - Dominates **90% of people** (the majority).  
- **Pattern of Behavior**:  
  - Follows popular beliefs uncritically. Resists contradictions and clings to biases (e.g., cheering patriotism without questioning it).  
  - Example: Mr. Houghton’s rants against foreigners, or the pious lady hating Germans.  
- **Effect**:  
  - Creates **false solidarity** but lacks depth. It’s comforting for the masses but perpetuates ignorance.  

###### Grade-Two Thinking  
- **Nature**:  
  - Focuses on **detecting contradictions** in others’ ideas. Critical but destructive, unable to build new systems.  
- **Proportion**:  
  - Fewer than Grade-Three thinkers but more common than Grade-One.  
- **Pattern of Behavior**:  
  - Questions norms, exposes hypocrisy (e.g., mocking politicians’ empty promises).  
  - Example: The author debating Ruth about religion.  
- **Effect**:  
  - Provides **intellectual excitement** but leaves one adrift (like a swimmer far from shore). It breeds dissatisfaction without offering solutions.  

###### Grade-One Thinking  
- **Nature**:  
  - Seeks **truth and coherence**. Constructs logical systems to understand the world.  
- **Proportion**:  
  - Extremely rare (“few and far between”).  
- **Pattern of Behavior**:  
  - Challenges all assumptions (e.g., rejecting marriage, governments, armies).  
  - Example: The author creating his own moral system.  
- **Effect**:  
  - Leads to **isolation** (losing friends, societal rejection) but offers moral clarity.  

##### Summary of the Three Grades of Thinking  
Based on William Golding’s essay *Thinking as a Hobby*, here’s a breakdown of the three levels of thinking:

###### Grade-Three Thinking  
- **Nature**:  
  - **Feeling, not thinking**: Relies on **prejudices, hypocrisy, and instinct** rather than logic.  
  - **Unconscious bias**: Driven by emotions, societal norms, or unquestioned beliefs (e.g., nationalism, tradition).  
- **Proportion**:  
  - **Most common**: Represents **90% of people** (the majority).  
- **Pattern of Behavior**:  
  - **Avoids questioning**: Defends beliefs aggressively, even when contradictory (e.g., Mr. Houghton’s hatred of France/America while claiming to “think”).  
  - **Hypocritical actions**: Preaches ideals (like purity) while acting against them (e.g., ogling girls during moral lectures).  
- **Effect**:  
  - **Creates false unity**: People bond over shared biases but reject critical analysis.  
  - **Resists change**: Dislikes contradictions and punishes those who point them out.  

###### Grade-Two Thinking  
- **Nature**:  
  - **Detects contradictions**: Questions hypocrisy and irrationality but **lacks solutions**.  
  - **Critical but destructive**: Tears down flawed ideas without building new ones.  
- **Proportion**:  
  - **Smaller group**: Less common than grade-three thinkers but more than grade-one.  
- **Pattern of Behavior**:  
  - **Skeptical and rebellious**: Challenges authority and traditions (e.g., mocking patriotism or religious claims).  
  - **Isolating**: Leads to loneliness as others feel threatened (e.g., losing Ruth after exposing her flawed logic).  
- **Effect**:  
  - **Intellectual freedom**: Encourages questioning but leaves a void (“out of depth”).  
  - **No fulfillment**: Provides excitement but no answers, like a swimmer far from shore.  

###### Grade-One Thinking  
- **Nature**:  
  - **Seeks truth**: Aims to build **logical, coherent systems** for understanding life.  
  - **Creative and idealistic**: Tries to replace flawed systems with rational ones (e.g., abolishing war, marriage).  
- **Proportion**:  
  - **Extremely rare**: Few people ever reach this level.  
- **Pattern of Behavior**:  
  - **Radical and uncompromising**: Rejects societal norms entirely (e.g., dismissing governments, armies).  
  - **Isolated**: Seen as a threat, leading to social rejection (e.g., losing friends and romantic prospects).  
- **Effect**:  
  - **Philosophical clarity**: Offers a moral framework but is impractical for most.  
  - **Alienation**: Too extreme for society, which prefers comfort over truth.  

###### Simplified Comparison  
| **Aspect**     | **Grade-Three**            | **Grade-Two**                  | **Grade-One**                   |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| **Core Trait** | Feelings/Prejudices        | Detecting Flaws                | Seeking Truth                   |
| **Strengths**  | Social unity, simplicity   | Critical awareness             | Logical ideals                  |
| **Weaknesses** | Hypocrisy, stagnation      | No solutions, isolation        | Impractical, alienating         |
| **Proportion** | Majority (90%)             | Smaller minority               | Rare (almost nonexistent)       |
| **Example**    | Mr. Houghton’s nationalism | Narrator debating Ruth’s faith | Narrator’s utopian moral system |

###### Key Takeaway  
- **Grade-three** dominates society but is shallow.  
- **Grade-two** disrupts illusions but offers no replacement.  
- **Grade-one** strives for truth but is too radical for acceptance.  
Golding concludes that most people cling to grade-three thinking for comfort, while true thinkers face isolation.

---

##### 2. Summary of Key Points  
- **Grade-Three Thinking**:  
  - **Key Idea**: Instinctive, biased, and hypocritical.  
  - **Details**: Symbolized by Mr. Houghton’s neck movements (prejudice over logic). People follow crowds like cows grazing the same way.  
- **Grade-Two Thinking**:  
  - **Key Idea**: Critical but unproductive.  
  - **Details**: Exposes flaws (e.g., fox-hunting excuses, political contradictions) but offers no alternatives. Leads to fun but emptiness.  
- **Grade-One Thinking**:  
  - **Key Idea**: Pursuit of truth through logical systems.  
  - **Details**: Rare and radical (rejecting societal norms). The author’s attempt causes social exile but personal integrity.  

---

##### 3. Simplified Paraphrase of Key Sections  
- **Grade-Three Thinking**:  
  - Most people don’t really think—they just repeat what they’re told. They stick to biases and get angry if you question them. Mr. Houghton hated foreigners but couldn’t explain why.  
- **Grade-Two Thinking**:  
  - This is about pointing out flaws. For example, politicians say they want peace but refuse to join peace groups. It’s fun to argue, but it doesn’t help you find answers.  
- **Grade-One Thinking**:  
  - The highest level: trying to find the truth and live by it. The author tried this by rejecting things like marriage and governments, but people thought he was crazy.  

**Example Paraphrase of a Passage**:  

- Original: *“Grade-two thinking destroys without having the power to create.”*  
- Simplified: *“Grade-two thinkers tear down ideas but can’t build anything better.”*  

**Final Note**:  
The author ends by saying he “turned professional”—meaning he stopped just critiquing (Grade-Two) and committed to seeking truth (Grade-One), even if it meant loneliness. He’d now place the Thinker statue in shadows, showing how hard true thinking is, with the leopard (Nature) ready to pounce, symbolizing life’s unpredictability.

The blockbuster film emerged as one of dominant Hollywood productions following the great success of Jaws. Both The Matrix and Titanic epitomize this formula, sharing core characteristics. While their narratives diverge dramatically, with one exploring a dystopian AI-ruled future and the other focusing a historical shipwreck, their structural and thematic commonalities reveal the core of the blockbuster genre, including a reliance on high-concept premises, spectacle over narrative complexity and genre hybridity.  

Firstly, based on features of the High-concept Film offering in textbooks, I think both of the Matrix and Titanic could be defined as High-concept Film meaning both of their premise can be reduced to an intriguing and appealing one-liner (P91). The Matrix hinges on the idea that “reality is a computer-generated illusion,”  which is easily graspable, just like Titanic’s foundational hook: a romance set against the backdrop of a disaster. As Don Simpson, architect of the “high-concept” philosophy, argued, blockbusters thrive on ideas that are “imaginative, original, and in some way new and unique.” (P84) Titanic’s fusion of historical tragedy and fictional love story also presented combination of spectacle with emotional resonance. Both films prioritize ensuring their plots transcend cultural and linguistic barriers to appeal global audiences.  

Moreover, blockbusters prioritize spectacular action sequences and effects to attract audiences back to cinema, an effective strategy rooted in Hollywood’s post-war competition with television.(P83) The Matrix revolutionized filmmaking with its “bullet-time” effects and "flow motion" technique, creating sequences where pure spectacle suspends narrative demands. (P89) Similarly, Titanic’s spectacle lies in its meticulous recreation of the ship’s sinking, blending practical effects with CGI to immerse viewers in the disaster’s scale. 

Finally, blockbusters often mix genres to broaden appeal. The Matrix merges sci-fi, action, and martial arts, borrowing Hong Kong cinema’s kinetic fight styles (P86). Titanic combines historical drama, romance, and disaster epic, weaving fictionalized personal stakes into a well-known historical event. This hybridity allows both films to cater to diverse audience tastes while maintaining a cohesive identity. 

The Matrix and Titanic reflect Hollywood’s strategy to counter television’s rise and dominate global markets through their high-concept premises, genre-blending narratives, and focus on visual innovation reflect Hollywood’s strategy to counter television’s rise and dominate global markets. While The Matrix leans into postmodern philosophy and Titanic into historical romanticism, both films prioritize sensory impact over complexity, proving that blockbusters thrive not on storytelling way but on their ability to transform cinema into an immersive experience.

**Like *The Matrix*, *Titanic* is often classified as a blockbuster. What do the two films have in common?**  

The blockbuster film emerged as one of dominant Hollywood productions following the great success of Jaws. Both The Matrix and Titanic epitomize this formula, sharing core characteristics that cement their status as quintessential blockbusters. While their narratives diverge dramatically, with one exploring a dystopian AI-ruled future and the other stating a historical shipwreck, their structural and thematic commonalities reveal the blueprint of the blockbuster genre. These include a reliance on high-concept premises, spectacle over narrative complexity, genre hybridity, and multimedia commercial exploitation.  

**1. High-Concept Premises**  

Based on features of the High-concept Film offering in textbooks, I think both of the Matrix and Titanic could be defined as High-concept Film meaning both of their premise can be reduced to an intriguing and appealing one-liner (P91). The Matrix hinges on the idea that “reality is a computer-generated illusion,”  which is easily graspable, just like Titanic’s foundational hook: a romance set against the backdrop of an infamous disaster. As Don Simpson, architect of the “high-concept” philosophy, argued, blockbusters thrive on ideas that are “imaginative, original, and in some way new and unique.” Titanic’s fusion of historical tragedy and fictional love story offered a similarly potent concept—melding spectacle with emotional resonance. Both films prioritize accessibility, ensuring their premises transcend cultural and linguistic barriers to captivate global audiences.  

**2. Spectacle Over Narrative Complexity**  

Blockbusters prioritize spectacular action sequences and effects to attract audiences back to cinema, an effective strategy rooted in Hollywood’s post-war competition with television.(P83) The Matrix revolutionized filmmaking with its “bullet-time” effects and "flow motion" technique, creating sequences where pure spectacle suspends narrative demands. (P89) Similarly, Titanic’s spectacle lies in its meticulous recreation of the ship’s sinking, blending practical effects with CGI to immerse viewers in the disaster’s scale. 

> Both films subordinate psychological depth to sensory stimulation: The Matrix reduces characters to archetypal “functions” (e.g., Neo as “the One”), while Titanic simplifies its protagonists into symbols of love and sacrifice. This emphasis on spectacle ensures their stories resonate universally, even if emotional or intellectual nuances are streamlined.  

**3. Genre Hybridity**  

Blockbusters often fuse genres to broaden appeal, and both films exemplify this eclectic approach. The Matrix merges sci-fi, action, and martial arts, borrowing Hong Kong cinema’s kinetic fight styles and anime aesthetics. Titanic combines historical drama, romance, and disaster epic, weaving fictionalized personal stakes into a well-known historical event. This hybridity allows both films to cater to diverse audience tastes while maintaining a cohesive identity. For instance, The Matrix’s “science fiction action adventure” framework and Titanic’s “romantic-historical epic” structure ensure they transcend niche categorizations, appealing to viewers seeking both escapism and emotional engagement.  

**4. Commercial Exploitation and Franchise Building**  

Finally, both films exemplify the blockbuster’s economic logic through multimedia expansion and merchandising. The Matrix spawned sequels, anime (Animatrix), video games, and merchandise (e.g., sunglasses, mobile phones), transforming it into a cultural franchise. Similarly, Titanic’s re-releases, soundtrack dominance, and themed exhibitions extended its commercial lifespan. Both films leveraged spectacle’s adaptability across platforms—The Matrix’s action sequences inspired video games, while *Titanic*’s visuals became synonymous with cinematic grandeur. This cross-platform exploitation maximizes profitability, a hallmark of the blockbuster model.  

**Conclusion**

The Matrix and Titanic embody the blockbuster’s dual mandate: to dazzle audiences with spectacle while ensuring commercial viability through simplicity and adaptability. Their high-concept premises, genre-blending narratives, and focus on visual innovation reflect Hollywood’s strategy to counter television’s rise and dominate global markets. While The Matrix leans into postmodern philosophy and *Titanic* into historical romanticism, both films prioritize sensory impact over complexity, proving that blockbusters thrive not on storytelling nuance but on their ability to transform cinema into a shared, immersive experience.

    1.   How can the two other theories of humor (ie. humour as disparagement and humour as release) be used to explain the humour of Forrest Gump? (P110)
    2.   Do you think it is acceptable for Hollywood to rewrite history? (P120)
    3.   Why do you think Forrest Gump is popular in China? (P120)

Forrest Gump’s enduring popularity in China originates from its culturally resonant values, accessible humor and relatable protagonist mirroring our own lives by his journey. His story feels universal, touching hearts through simplicity and quiet strength.
In Helen Gardner’s theory, she thought comedy is "an image of the flow of human life" and celebrates life’s cyclical renewal through marriage and procreation(P105). So did Gump’s whole life. From his devotion to Jenny to the scene where his son boards the same school bus he once rode not only symbolize hope, but also is a lifeline for a generation anxious about fractured families and. Although traditional family bonds strain under city pressures as China urbanizes rapidly, we still have our ordinary and simple longing for stability with family.
During these few years, China’s breakneck development leaves many feeling overwhelming. In this film, while Jenny’s life reflects the pain of fighting against the current, whose life is filled with challenges like most of us, Gump floats through Vietnam, ping-pong diplomacy, and business effortlessly.  To young Chinese battling "involution", his unforced and accidental triumphs just like saying "sometimes breathing is enough to obtain everything. Let drifting in the social flood I are very envious, but know that I do not have the innocence and luck of Gump.
As a famous comedy, this film’s humor transcends language barriers through its gentle absurdity, or could be explained as incongruity humor. For example, Gump’s literal take on the world, like insisting a legless Lt. Dan is "still Lt. Dan", exposes contradictions in life without complex wordplay. (P109) His reflection at Jenny's grave that destiny and chance might "both happen at the same time" blends illogic with unexpected insight, showing viewers'real life in a peculiar vision. (P110) This binding of laughter and emotional depth fits for Chinese storytelling, where laughter and tears often coexist to cleanse the heart.
What makes this film so popular in China is chatactersation and portrayal of Gump himself, a character who feels both familiar and inspiring. Gump, an idiot savant who sees truth where others see nonsense from "wise fool" perspective, draws audiences into his world. As the director noted, Gump’s "blank slate" nature lets viewers see themselves in his struggles and triumphs, transforming him into a mirror for their own dreams and frustrations.
Ultimately, Forrest Gump endures in China because it champions moral clarity in a complex age. Gump’s loyalty and hard work affirm that goodness can prevail without cynicism, reminding us that innocence and perseverance remain virtues in any society and any ages.







##### v1

**Why *Forrest Gump* Resonates Deeply with Chinese Audiences**  

*Forrest Gump*’s enduring popularity in China originates from its culturally resonant values, accessible humor and relatable narrative structure

1. Cultural Resonance with Chinese Values  

    - **Family and Continuity**: Helen Gardner’s theory—that comedy celebrates life’s cyclical renewal through marriage and birth—fits Gump’s arc. His devotion to Jenny, their child’s birth, and the closing school-bus scene symbolize hope and generational continuity, echoing traditional Chinese emphases on family legacy.  
    - **Harmony vs. Chaos**: Gump’s accidental triumphs amid historical turmoil (Vietnam, Watergate) contrast with Jenny’s self-destructive path. This duality reflects Daoist principles: Gump’s *wu-wei* (effortless action) brings success, while Jenny’s forced rebellion leads to tragedy. The film subtly endorses balance—a core tenet in Chinese philosophy.  
    - **Collective Memory**: Gump’s encounters with iconic U.S. events (e.g., ping-pong diplomacy) intersect with Sino-American history, allowing Chinese viewers to engage with global narratives through a personal lens.  

1. 与中国价值观的文化共鸣  

   - 家庭与延续：符合阿甘的弧线。他对珍妮的爱，他们孩子的出生，以及最后的校车场景，都象征着希望和世代延续，与中国传统的注重家庭传承的观念相呼应。 
   - 和谐与混乱： 阿甘在历史动荡（越南战争、水门事件）中的偶然胜利与珍妮的自我毁灭形成鲜明对比。这种二元对立反映了道家的原则： 阿甘的*无为*（不费吹灰之力的行动）带来了成功，而珍妮的被迫反抗则导致了悲剧。影片巧妙地体现了中国哲学的核心原则--平衡。 
   - 集体记忆： 阿甘与美国标志性事件（如乒乓外交）的邂逅与中美历史交织在一起，让中国观众能够通过 “乒乓外交 ”的视角参与全球叙事。

2. Accessible Humor and Emotional Depth  

   The film leverages **incongruity humor**—where Gump’s literal-mindedness highlights societal absurdities—without relying on language-specific wit. Examples from the text:  

   - Gump insisting a legless Lt. Dan is "still Lt. Dan" exposes the irony of self-identity crises.  
   - His speech at Jenny’s grave ("Maybe both [destiny and chance] happen at the same time") blends illogic with poetic truth, inviting reflection on life’s ambiguities. 
     This humor transcends translation, while the film’s tragicomic balance—mixing laughter with poignant loss—aligns with Chinese storytelling traditions that value emotional catharsis.  

4. Relatable Protagonist and Narrative Structure

    - **Identification with Gump**: As the text explains, audiences progress from *recognizing* Gump as a "wise fool" archetype to *adopting his perspective* via first-person narration. His "blank slate" nature (per director Zemeckis) lets viewers project their ideals onto him, making him a vessel for shared dreams and frustrations.  
    - **Cyclical Narrative**: The film’s episodic, circular structure—echoing "life’s endless renewal" (Frye)—resonates with Chinese aesthetics. Scenes like young Forrest’s bus ride mirroring his son’s departure symbolize fate’s continuity, offering comfort in predictability amid chaos.  

Conclusion: Escapism with Moral Clarity  

Gump’s triumphs through sincerity validate virtues like loyalty ("I’m not a smart man, but I know what love is") and hard work. Unlike the U.S., where debates about historical revisionism dominated, Chinese audiences embraced the film as an *affirmation of human goodness* against cynicism. By blending comedy’s "joyful rebirth" with the wise fool’s timeless insights, the film transcends culture, reminding viewers that in any society, innocence paired with perseverance can be revolutionary.

*Forrest Gump*’s enduring popularity in China is no accident—it speaks directly to universal values that resonate across cultures while weaving humor and heart into a uniquely relatable tapestry. At its core, the film celebrates timeless ideals cherished in Chinese society: family, harmony, and the quiet wisdom found in simplicity. Gump’s journey mirrors life’s cyclical nature, from his devotion to Jenny to the poignant scene where his son boards the same school bus he once rode. This theme of generational continuity echoes deeply in a culture that treasures family legacy, offering comfort in the idea that love and hope persist through life’s twists.

Moving beyond family, the film’s balance between chaos and order strikes a chord with Chinese philosophical traditions. While Jenny’s turbulent life reflects the pain of fighting against the current, Gump’s accidental triumphs—achieved through sincerity rather than force—embody the Daoist principle of *wu-wei*, or effortless action. His unintentional success amid historical upheavals, like the Vietnam War or the ping-pong diplomacy era, even intersects with shared Sino-American memories, allowing Chinese audiences to see global history through intimate, human eyes.

除了家庭之外，影片在混乱与秩序之间的平衡也与中国的哲学传统不谋而合。珍妮动荡的人生反映了逆流而上的痛苦，而阿甘意外的胜利--通过真诚而非武力获得的胜利--则体现了道家的 “无为 ”原则，即不费吹灰之力。他在越战、乒乓外交等历史动荡中的无意成功，甚至与中美两国的共同记忆产生了交集，让中国观众从亲切、人性的视角来看待全球历史。



The film’s humor, too, transcends language barriers through its gentle absurdity. Gump’s literal take on the world—like insisting a legless Lt. Dan is "still Lt. Dan"—playfully exposes life’s contradictions without needing complex wordplay. His graveside reflection that destiny and chance might "both happen at the same time" blends illogic with unexpected insight, inviting viewers to laugh while pondering life’s mysteries. This mix of lightheartedness and emotional depth aligns with Chinese storytelling, where laughter and tears often coexist to cleanse the heart (*xie*).

影片的幽默也通过其温和的荒诞性超越了语言障碍。阿甘对世界的字面理解--比如坚持认为没有腿的丹中尉 “仍然是丹中尉”--俏皮地揭示了生活中的矛盾，而不需要复杂的文字游戏。他在墓前的反思，即命运和机遇可能 “同时发生”，将不合逻辑和出人意料的洞察力融为一体，让观众在欢笑中思考人生的奥秘。这种轻松与情感深度的结合符合中国人讲故事的习惯，即笑与泪并存，以净化心灵（*xie*）。



Central to its appeal is Gump himself, a character who feels both familiar and inspiring. His "wise fool" perspective—seeing truth where others see nonsense—draws audiences into his world, while the film’s circular structure, echoing life’s endless cycles, offers a soothing rhythm in an unpredictable world. As the director noted, Gump’s "blank slate" nature lets viewers see themselves in his struggles and triumphs, transforming him into a mirror for their own dreams.

Ultimately, *Forrest Gump* endures in China because it champions moral clarity in a complex age. Gump’s loyalty and hard work—epitomized by his line, "I’m not a smart man, but I know what love is"—affirm that goodness can prevail without cynicism. Where American debates focused on historical reinterpretation, Chinese audiences embraced the film as a testament to resilience, reminding us that innocence and perseverance remain quietly revolutionary virtues in any society.

*阿甘正传* 在中国经久不衰绝非偶然--它直接讲述了引起不同文化共鸣的普世价值观，同时将幽默和真情编织成一幅独特的亲情挂毯。影片的核心是颂扬中国社会所珍视的永恒理想：家庭、和谐以及在简单中发现的宁静智慧。阿甘的心路历程反映了生命的周期性，从他对珍妮的奉献，到他的儿子登上他曾经乘坐过的校车的感人场景。这种代代相传的主题在珍视家族传承的文化中得到了深刻的回响，让人在爱与希望在人生的曲折中得以延续的理念中得到慰藉。

阿甘的核心魅力在于阿甘本人，他是一个让人感觉既熟悉又鼓舞人心的人物。他的 “聪明的傻瓜 ”视角--在别人看来是无稽之谈的地方看到了真相--吸引观众进入他的世界，而影片的循环结构呼应了生命的无尽循环，在变幻莫测的世界中提供了一种舒缓的节奏。正如导演所说，阿甘的 “白板 ”特性让观众从他的奋斗和胜利中看到自己，把他变成自己梦想的一面镜子。

阿甘正传》之所以在中国经久不衰，归根结底是因为它在一个复杂的时代里倡导了清晰的道德观。阿甘的忠诚和辛勤工作--他的台词 “我不是个聪明人，但我知道什么是爱”--证明了善良可以战胜愤世嫉俗。美国人的争论集中在对历史的重新解读上，而中国观众则将这部影片视为坚韧不拔的见证，提醒我们在任何社会中，纯真和坚毅仍然是静悄悄的革命美德。





##### v3

Forrest Gump’s deep connection with Chinese audiences grows from how his journey mirrors our own lives—especially in today’s fast-changing China. His story isn’t just American; it feels universal, touching hearts through simplicity and quiet strength.  

**Family Roots in Modern Flux** 
As China urbanizes rapidly, traditional family bonds strain under city pressures. Gump’s devotion to Jenny and his son echoes our longing for stability. That final scene, where little Forrest boards the same school bus, isn’t just hopeful; it’s a lifeline for a generation anxious about fractured families and uncertain futures.  

**现代变迁中的家庭根基**
随着中国城市化的快速发展，传统的家庭纽带在城市压力下变得脆弱。阿甘对珍妮和儿子的挚爱，呼应了我们对稳定生活的渴望。影片最后，小阿甘登上同一辆校车的场景，不仅充满希望，更是对一代因家庭破碎和未来不确定而焦虑的一代人的生命线。

**Chaos vs. Calm in a Racing Society** 
China’s breakneck development leaves many feeling overwhelming. Here, Gump’s accidental success speaks volumes. While Jenny fights the system and loses, he floats through Vietnam, ping-pong diplomacy, and business like a feather—*effortless* (无为). To young Chinese battling "involution" (内卷), his unforced triumphs whisper: *Sometimes breathing is enough*.  

**奔跑社会中的混乱与平静**
中国的飞速发展让许多人感到茫然无措。在这里，阿甘的意外成功意义非凡。珍妮与体制抗争并最终失败，而他却轻盈地游走于越南战争、乒乓外交和商业领域——“毫不费力”*。对于那些正在与“内卷”抗争的中国年轻人来说，他自然而然的胜利仿佛在低语：“有时呼吸就足够了。”

**Laughter That Cuts Through Noise** 
His humor needs no translation. When Gump tells legless Lt. Dan "You’re still Lt. Dan!", we laugh—but also pause. In a society obsessed with status and success, his words quietly rebel: *Your worth isn’t your job, legs, or bank account*. At Jenny’s grave, mixing fate and chance, he voices what many feel but can’t articulate: Life’s messiness defies logic.

**穿透喧嚣的笑声**
他的幽默无需翻译。当阿甘对失去双腿的丹中尉说“你还是丹中尉！”时，我们大笑——但也随之停顿。在一个痴迷于地位和成功的社会，他的话语悄然反抗：“你的价值不在于你的工作、双腿或银行账户*。”在珍妮的墓前，他交织着命运与机遇，说出了许多人感同身受却无法言喻的话语：人生的纷乱违背逻辑。

**The "Fool" Who Feels Like Family** 
Gump isn’t heroic—he’s familiarly imperfect. As China’s youth face pressure to be exceptional, his ordinary goodness comforts us. His blank-slate heart lets viewers project their struggles: exams, lost love, or parental hopes. When he runs, we remember escaping stress; when he waits years for Jenny, we see our own loyalty.  

**感觉像家人一样的“傻瓜”**
阿甘并非英雄——他有着人们所熟悉的不完美。当中国的年轻人面临着成为佼佼者的压力时，他平凡的善良给了我们安慰。他那颗空白的心让观众能够投射出他们内心的挣扎：考试、失恋，或是父母的期望。当他奔跑时，我们想起的是逃避压力；当他等待珍妮多年时，我们看到的是自己的忠诚。

**Why It Still Matters**
In a world of algorithms and competition, Gump is human. He needs no WeChat moments or diplomas to prove his value—his kindness *is* his revolution. For Chinese audiences balancing tradition and modernity, he’s a compass: **In the rush to develop, don’t lose your soul.** 

**《阿甘正传》在中国的持久魅力**

阿甘正传与中国观众的深厚联系源于他的人生历程如何映射我们自身的处境——尤其是在当今瞬息万变的中国。他的故事并非只具有美国特色，而是具有普世意义，以朴素和静默的力量触动人心。







**为何它依然重要**
在这个充斥着算法和竞争的世界里，阿甘也是人。他不需要微信朋友圈或文凭来证明自己的价值——他的善良*就是*他的革命。对于在传统与现代之间寻求平衡的中国观众来说，他是一枚指南针：**在急于求成的过程中，别迷失了灵魂。**

  1. In her book, Stiffed: The Betrayal of American Men, Susan Faludi claims that the traditional ideal of manhood in the us depended upon four factors:

     (i) a frontier to be claimed (ii)a "clear and evil enemy" to be crushed (iii) an institutional brotherhood, and (iv) a family to provide for and protect

     None of these factors applies, she argues, in contemporary America. How does American Beauty reflect this? (P130)

     在《寸步难行:被背叛的美国男性》一书中,苏珊·法吕迪宣称在美国传统中男性的男子气概依赖于四个因素:(1)需要征服的土地;(2)需要打败的邪恶敌人;(3)约定俗成的手足情谊和(4)需要供养和保护的家庭。她认为,在现代美国,这四点已经都不存在了。《美国丽人》是如何表现这个问题的?

  2. Does the idea of a "Crisis in Masculinity"have any significance in China? (P140)

     男性危机 "这一观点在中国是否有意义？(P140)

  3. How do Chinese films deal with the problem of the "mid-life crisis"? (P140)

     中国电影如何处理 “中年危机 ”问题？(P140)

This idea works in China. While China’s social and cultural context differs from the West, similarities exist in arguments about masculinity. Chinese men are caught between old traditions rooted in values of familial responsibility and social stability and a fast-changing world.

First, tradition clashes with reality. Chinese masculinity used to mean a men should be imprisoned in the cage of the responsibility of supporting the family and being both civil and military. 
Nowadays, rising female workforce participation forced men to think or change their role in society and family. However, we still can see most of men trapped in soulless office jobs only fighting for apartments to their marriages under the discipline of traditional thinking.

Then there’s social change. Some of young men embraced pop culture pushing soft, emotional masculinity, but traditional norms might call that weak. The subconscious patriarchy system has almost become deeply rooted, families still expect men euipped with traditional toughness making some of men exhausting to try to fit all these roles.

Luckily, unlike individual heroism chased by Western culture, collective advancement in Chinese culture gives everyone who is struggling sense of bigger purpose, pushing both men and women lifting the whole country.

###### v1

While China’s socio-cultural context differs from the West, parallels exist in debates about masculinity. Traditional Chinese masculinity (*wen-wu* 文武) emphasized scholarly refinement (*wen*) and martial prowess (*wu*), anchored in Confucian values of familial responsibility and social stability. However, rapid modernization has triggered shifts:  

1. **Economic Pressures**:  
   Urbanization and competitive capitalism have eroded traditional male roles as sole breadwinners. Rising female workforce participation (e.g., 45% of China’s tech sector) challenges the "provider" model, mirroring Western alienation in post-industrial economies.  

2. **Cultural Globalization**:  
   Western media imports (e.g., Hollywood films, social media) popularize ideals of individualism and emotional expressiveness, conflicting with stoic Confucian norms. Youth subcultures increasingly reject rigid gender roles, embracing androgynous aesthetics (*xiaoxianrou* 小鲜肉).  

3. **Demographic Strains**:  
   Gender imbalances (34 million more men by 2030) intensify competition for marriage, amplifying anxieties about financial "worthiness." The term *diaosi* (屌丝, "loser") critiques men failing socioeconomic expectations.  

**Divergences**:  

- **State Narrative**: China’s "National Rejuvenation" rhetoric promotes assertive, patriotic masculinity (e.g., Wolf Warrior diplomacy), countering crisis narratives.  
- **Collectivist Buffers**: Family structures remain central; 85% of unmarried men live with parents, sustaining filial roles.  
- **No "Frontier" Myth**: Unlike America, China lacks a historical frontier ethos. Struggles focus on collective advancement (e.g., poverty alleviation), not individual heroism.  

*Conclusion*: China faces *pressures* on masculinity but avoids a full-blown "crisis." Traditional frameworks adapt rather than collapse, with state and family institutions providing stability absent in Faludi’s US analysis.  

虽然中国的社会文化背景与西方不同，但关于男性气质的争论却有相似之处。中国传统的男子气概（*文武*）强调文质彬彬（*文*）和武艺高强（*武*），以儒家的家庭责任和社会稳定价值观为基础。然而，快速的现代化引发了转变：  
1. **经济压力**：
   城市化和竞争性资本主义削弱了男性作为唯一养家糊口者的传统角色。女性劳动力参与率的上升（例如，中国科技行业中女性占 45%）挑战了 “提供者 ”模式，反映了西方后工业化经济体中的异化现象。 
2. **文化全球化**：
   西方媒体的输入（如好莱坞电影、社交媒体）普及了个人主义和情感表达的理想，这与委婉的儒家规范相冲突。青年亚文化越来越摒弃僵化的性别角色，崇尚雌雄同体的审美观（*xiaoxianrou* 小鲜肉）。 
3. **人口压力**： 
   性别失衡（到 2030 年男性人数将增加 3400 万）加剧了婚姻竞争，扩大了对经济 “价值 ”的焦虑。屌丝 “一词意为 ”失败者"，批评男性辜负了社会经济期望。

**分歧**：  

- **国家叙事**： 中国的 “民族复兴 ”言论宣扬自信、爱国的阳刚之气（如 “战狼外交”），与危机叙事相抗衡。 
- **集体主义缓冲**： 家庭结构仍然是核心；85% 的未婚男性与父母生活在一起，维持着孝顺的角色。 
- **没有 “边疆 ”神话**： 与美国不同，中国缺乏历史上的边疆精神。斗争的重点是集体进步（如扶贫），而不是个人英雄主义。 
*结论*： 中国面临着男性气质的*压力，但避免了全面的 “危机”。传统框架适应而非崩溃，国家和家庭机构提供了法鲁迪在美国分析中没有的稳定性。 

###### v2

Yeah, this whole "crisis of masculinity" thing—it’s mostly talked about in the West, but honestly, you can feel its echoes here in China too. Not exactly the same, but close enough. See, Chinese guys are caught between old traditions and a fast-changing world. It’s confusing, and it weighs on them.  

Back in the day, men were supposed to be like Confucian pillars—strong, steady providers (*wu*), but also cultured and wise (*wen*). Now? Jobs are unstable, women are killing it in careers, and guys feel pressure to be both tough and sensitive. It’s messy. You see it in small ways: dudes stressing over buying apartments to get married, or feeling useless in soulless office jobs. There’s even slang like *diaosi* ("loser") for men who can’t keep up.  

And pop culture doesn’t help. Western movies and K-pop idols make guys feel they should look perfect (*xiaoxianrou*—pretty boys with soft vibes), while traditional voices say, "Be a real man!" Plus, with millions more men than women, competition is fierce. It’s exhausting trying to fit all these roles.  

But here’s the twist: China’s not melting down over it like America might. Families stick together—most single guys still live with parents, so they’re not totally adrift. And the government pushes this "strong China" narrative (think *Wolf Warrior* diplomacy), which gives guys a kind of patriotic purpose. No wild frontier to conquer, but there’s pride in national progress.  

So yeah, the crisis whispers here—but it doesn’t scream. Guys are adapting, not breaking.  

是的，这种观念在中国也很重要，但方式不同。中国男人在旧传统和新压力之间感到压力重重。

过去，男人应该成为强大的“武”和明智的“文”。但如今的世界却令人困惑。工作不稳定，女性在职场上取得成功，而男人则在思考：“我应该坚强还是温柔？养家糊口还是情绪化？” 这种压力随处可见——男人为了结婚而拼命买房，感觉自己被困在无聊的办公室工作中，或者因为生活挣扎而被叫做“屌丝”。

流行文化让情况更加混乱。韩国流行歌星和好莱坞电影推崇“小鲜肉”的形象，而老一辈则说“做个真正的男人！” 到2030年，男性人口将增加3000万，找对象就像一场比赛。

但中国并不像西方那样惊慌失措。家庭团结——大多数单身男性与父母同住，所以他们并不孤单。政府还大力推崇“强国”的故事（比如《战狼》电影），让男性感到国家自豪而非个人目标。这里没有蛮荒之地，但建设中国感觉像是一项共同的使命。

所以，没错，中国男性感受到了压力，但他们正在适应——而不是崩溃。

###### v3

Yeah, this idea isn’t just a Western thing—it’s quietly bubbling under the surface in China too. Not exactly a full-blown "crisis," but you can feel the tension. Let me break it down plainly.

First, **tradition clashes with reality**. Chinese masculinity used to mean being a stable provider (*wu*) or a cultured scholar (*wen*). But today? Men are squeezed. Jobs feel meaningless—stuck in offices or factories, doing work that doesn’t *feel* important. Women are rising fast in careers (nearly half the workforce now), which is great but leaves some men unsure of their role. And marriage? Forget it unless you own a home—apartment prices in cities are insane.

Then there’s **social change**. Young guys see K-pop idols and Western movies pushing soft, emotional masculinity (*xiaoxianrou*), but their dads might call that "weak." Families still expect traditional toughness. Plus, there are *34 million more men* than women by 2030—so competition for partners is fierce. Ever heard the slang *diaosi* ("loser")? It’s tossed at men who can’t meet these pressures. You feel it in daily life: anxiety about money, looks, status.

But here’s the twist—**China’s handling it differently**. Families stick together like glue. Most single men live with parents, so they’re not alone. The government pushes "national pride" narratives (like *Wolf Warrior* patriotism), giving guys a sense of bigger purpose. And there’s no "frontier" myth here—struggles are about lifting the whole country, not solo heroism. Poverty campaigns, tech advances—it’s collective, not individual.

**So, is it a crisis?** Not like in America. It’s more like quiet stress. Men adapt. They juggle old expectations and new realities. Some crack under pressure, but most find balance—leaning on family, work, or national identity. The system here softens the blow.

Bottom line: The *feeling* of unease is real, but China’s structure—family, state, shared goals—keeps it from becoming chaos. It’s pressure, not panic.

是的，这种想法并非西方独有——在中国也悄然酝酿。虽然不算是一场全面的“危机”，但你也能感受到其中的紧张。让我来简单分析一下。

首先，传统与现实的冲突。中国式的男子气概过去意味着要成为一个稳定的“武”或一个有文化的“文”。但如今呢？男人受到了挤压。工作感觉毫无意义——被困在办公室或工厂里，做着感觉无关紧要的工作。女性在职场上快速崛起（现在几乎占劳动力的一半），这固然很好，但也让一些男性对自己的角色感到迷茫。至于婚姻？除非你有房子，否则别想结婚——城市的房价高得离谱。

然后是社会变革。年轻男性看到韩国偶像和西方电影宣扬温柔、感性的“小鲜肉”，但他们的父亲可能会称之为“软弱”。家庭仍然期待传统的“强势”。此外，到2030年，男性数量将比女性多3400万，因此伴侣竞争异常激烈。听说过俚语“屌丝”（loser）吗？这个词指的是那些无法承受这些压力的男性。你在日常生活中都能感受到它：对金钱、外貌和地位的焦虑。

但问题在于——中国处理这个问题的方式不同。家庭成员紧密相连。大多数单身男性与父母同住，所以他们并不孤单。政府大力推广“民族自豪感”（例如战狼式的爱国主义），让男性拥有更远大的目标感。这里没有“边疆”的迷思——奋斗是为了振兴整个国家，而不是个人英雄主义。扶贫攻坚、科技进步——这是集体的，而不是个人的。

那么，这是一场危机吗？不像美国。这更像是一种无声的压力。男性需要适应。他们在旧的期望和新的现实之间挣扎。有些人会在压力下崩溃，但大多数人会找到平衡——依靠家庭、工作或民族认同。这里的体制减轻了打击。

总而言之：不安的感觉确实存在，但中国的结构——家庭、国家、共同目标——使其免于陷入混乱。这是压力，而不是恐慌。

American Beauty shows how lost men feel when everything they thought defined them vanishes. Susan Faludi nailed American manhood used to rest on four pillars, and Lester’s life is a proof of their collapsed.

First, there is no frontier to claim. Lester is stuck in a dead-end job with his boss treating him like trash, and his work meaning nothing.  Scenes of him photocopying documents contrast with his fantasy of grilling burgers. Instead of building something, he’s just a cog, no wonder he quits and starts lifting weights. It’s sad, like he’s pretending to be a hero in his own world.

Second, there is no enemy to fight. Because the villain of Lester is emptiness. His wife loves her perfect couch more than him and his neighbor is a closet gay man full of hate. Even society feels like the enemy, choking him with fake values, just wanting him to obey. So when Lester broke plates at dinner, it’s not anger, but despair.

Third, there is no institutional brotherhood. Lester has no friends, showing stark isolation. Colleagues like Brad are rivals, not allies or friends. His bond with Ricky is based on drug transaction. In the bar, Lester's staring at a confident waiter with admiration presents his strong longing for connection, but there's no sense of belonging for him.

Fourth, there is no family to provide for and protect. His wife mocks him; his daughter hates him and even wishes him to die. They’re strangers in the same house which isn't his refuge but his cage. Lester chases his daughter’s teenage friend just because Angela makes him feel alive again and his fantasy of Angela makes him retreating back to adolescent validation.

Finally, Lester's pillars collapsed representing masculinity’s crisis. So, in the end, when Fitts shoots Lester, who died with smiling at old photos, the movie screams: This world doesn’t need men like before. And that’s the real pain.

###### v1

*American Beauty* visually dissects Faludi’s thesis that American manhood lost its pillars:  

1. **No Frontier to Claim**:  
   Lester’s office job symbolizes meaningless modern labor. Scenes of him photocopying documents contrast with his fantasy of grilling burgers—a nod to lost productive purpose. His rebellion (quitting, lifting weights) parodies frontier conquest in suburban confinement.  

2. **No "Clear and Evil Enemy"**:  
   Antagonists are fragmented:  
   - **Carolyn** embodies consumerist emptiness.  
   - **Colonel Fitts** channels militarism into homophobic rage, attacking Lester after misreading Ricky’s relationship with him.  
   The film shows men fighting "invisible" forces (alienation, conformity), not tangible foes.  

3. **Brotherhood Collapse**:  
   Lester’s isolation is stark. Colleagues like Brad are rivals, not allies. His bond with Ricky is transactional (drugs), not communal. The bar scene—where Lester admires a waiter’s confidence—highlights his craving for masculine kinship, unmet in corporate or suburban life.  

4. **Family as Burden, Not Sanctuary**:  
   - Lester’s family mocks his authority (Jane: "You’re so lame").  
   - Carolyn’s affair and materialism negate spousal support.  
   His fantasy of Angela represents a retreat into adolescent validation, not adult responsibility.  

**Climax as Metaphor**:  
Lester’s death by Fitts’ gun merges all four failures:  

- Fitts, a veteran without a war (no frontier),  
- Projects self-hatred onto Lester (misplaced enemy),  
- Acts alone (no brotherhood),  
- Destroying a fractured family he envies.  

*Conclusion*: The film frames masculinity’s crisis as the implosion of Faludi’s pillars. Lester’s quest for freedom becomes self-destruction because society offers no constructive outlets for traditional male identity.

*美国之美*直观地剖析了法鲁迪关于美国男人失去支柱的论断：  

1. **没有领地**：  
   莱斯特的办公室工作象征着毫无意义的现代劳动。他复印文件的场景与他烤汉堡的幻想形成鲜明对比--这表明他失去了生产目的。他的叛逆（辞职、举重）模仿了郊区禁锢下的边疆征服。 

2. **没有 “明确而邪恶的敌人 ”**：  
   对立面支离破碎：  
   - 卡洛琳**体现了消费主义的空虚。 
   - 菲茨**上校将军国主义转化为对同性恋的愤怒，在误读了瑞奇与莱斯特的关系后对其进行攻击。 
     影片表现的是男性与 “无形 ”的力量（异化、墨守成规）而非有形的敌人的斗争。 

3. **兄弟关系的崩溃**：  
   莱斯特的孤立是显而易见的。布拉德等同事是对手，而不是盟友。他与瑞奇之间的联系是交易（毒品），而非共处。在酒吧里，莱斯特欣赏服务生的自信，这凸显了他对男性亲情的渴望，而这种渴望在公司或郊区生活中都得不到满足。 

4. **家庭是负担，不是避难所**：  
   - 莱斯特的家人嘲笑他的权威（简：“你太逊了”）。 
   - 卡罗琳的外遇和物质主义否定了配偶的支持。 
     他对安吉拉的幻想代表了青春期的退缩，而不是成年人的责任。 

作为隐喻的**高潮**：  
莱斯特死于菲茨的枪下，这四种失败合而为一：  

- 菲茨是一个没有打过仗的老兵（没有边界）、  
- 将自我憎恨投射到莱斯特身上（错位的敌人）、  
- 独自行动（没有兄弟情谊）、  
- 破坏了他所羡慕的支离破碎的家庭。 

*结论*： 影片将男性危机定格为法鲁迪支柱的内爆。莱斯特对自由的追求变成了自我毁灭，因为社会没有为传统男性身份提供建设性的出路。



###### v2

*American Beauty* hits hard because it shows how lost men feel when everything they thought defined them just... vanishes. Susan Faludi nailed it—American manhood used to rest on four pillars, and Lester Burnham’s life is proof they’ve crumbled.  

First, **no frontier to conquer**. Lester’s stuck in a dead-end job, pushing papers. His boss treats him like trash, and his work means nothing. You feel his shame when he fantasizes about flipping burgers—at least that’s *real*. Instead of building something, he’s just a cog. No wonder he quits and starts lifting weights. It’s sad, like he’s pretending to be a hero in his own garage.  

Second, **no clear enemy**. Who’s Lester fighting? Not some villain—just emptiness. His wife Carolyn cares more about her perfect couch than him. His neighbor Fitts is a closeted gay man so twisted by self-hate he lashes out. Even society feels like the enemy, choking him with fake values. When Lester smashes dinner plates, it’s not anger—it’s despair.  

Third, **no brotherhood**. Lester’s totally alone. His coworker Brad fires him with a smirk. His only "friend" is a teen drug dealer, Ricky, who’s just using him. That scene where Lester watches a confident waiter at a diner? You feel his ache for connection. But there’s no tribe for him anymore.  

Fourth, **no family to protect**. His wife mocks him. His daughter wishes he’d die. They’re strangers in the same house. So Lester chases a teenage girl, Angela—not because he’s creepy, but because she makes him feel alive again. It’s pathetic, but you get it. His family isn’t his sanctuary; it’s his cage.  

Then comes the end. Fitts shoots Lester, and it’s almost a mercy. Fitts himself is a broken man—a soldier with no war, no brotherhood, a family he terrorizes. When Lester dies smiling at old photos, it hurts because he only found beauty *after* he lost everything. The film’s message screams: *This world doesn’t need men anymore*. And that’s the real tragedy.

《美国丽人》之所以震撼人心，是因为它展现了当所有定义自己的事物都消失殆尽时，男人的失落感。苏珊·法露迪一针见血——美国男子气概曾经建立在四大支柱之上，而莱斯特·伯纳姆的人生恰恰证明了这四大支柱的崩塌。

首先，**没有可以征服的疆界**。莱斯特困在一份没有前途的工作里，做文书工作。他的老板把他当垃圾一样对待，他的工作毫无意义。当他幻想着翻汉堡时，你能感受到他的羞耻——至少那是*真实的*。他没有创造什么，而只是一个零件。难怪他辞职去练举重。这很可悲，就像他在自家车库里假装英雄一样。

其次，**没有明确的敌人**。莱斯特在与谁战斗？不是什么恶棍——只是空虚。他的妻子卡罗琳比他更在乎她那完美的沙发。他的邻居菲茨是个深柜同性恋，他被自我憎恨扭曲，以至于会发泄愤怒。就连社会也像敌人一样，用虚假的价值观扼杀着他。莱斯特摔碎餐盘时，那不是愤怒，而是绝望。

第三，**没有兄弟情谊**。莱斯特孤身一人。他的同事布拉德带着一丝冷笑解雇了他。他唯一的“朋友”是一个名叫瑞奇的青少年毒贩，只不过是在利用他。莱斯特在餐馆里看着一个自信满满的服务员的那一幕？你能感受到他渴望与人建立联系的渴望。但他已经没有了归属感。

第四，**没有家人需要保护**。他的妻子嘲笑他。他的女儿希望他死。他们是同一栋房子里的陌生人。所以莱斯特追逐一个名叫安吉拉的少女——不是因为他令人毛骨悚然，而是因为她让他重新感受到了生命。这很可悲，但你明白我的意思。他的家人并非他的庇护所，而是他的牢笼。

然后，结局来临。菲茨射杀了莱斯特，这几乎是出于仁慈。菲茨本人也已心碎——一个没有战争、没有兄弟情谊、被他恐吓的家人的士兵。莱斯特对着老照片微笑着死去，这令人心痛，因为他只有在失去一切之后才发现了美。这部电影传递的信息是：*这个世界不再需要男人*。而这才是真正的悲剧。

### Pre

First created in the French Civil Code in 1804

The principle of freedom of contract

Independent will of the parties

Interference of external coercive forces

The principle of freedom of contract was first created in the French Civil Code in 1804, but its theoretical origin can be traced back to Roman law. The principle of freedom of contract is an important principle in civil law systems. The principle of freedom of contract emphasises that the binding force of a contract comes from the independent will of the parties and not from the interference of external coercive forces. Based on the free meaning of the agreement and the establishment of the contract is reasonable, in order to produce between the parties equivalent to the legal effect of the coercive force.

契约自由原则首创于1804年的《法国民法典》，其理论渊源却可追溯到罗马法。

契约自由原则是大陆法系的一个重要原则。契约自由原则强调契约的约束力来源于当事人的自主意愿，并非外界强制力的干涉 。基于自由意思一致而成立的契约才具有合理性，才能在当事人之间产生相当于法律效力的强制力。


The first article, from the Ladder of Jurisprudence, means that in contracts of sale, lease, partnership and trust, the relationship of debt is established by the mere consent of the parties.
The second article is from the ‘Jurisprudence’, which means that in oral agreements and other contracts, we always follow the consent of the parties.
Both of these articles reflect the idea of freedom of contract in Roman law.

第一条出自《法学阶梯》，意思是：在买卖、租赁、合伙和委托等合同中，债的关系仅凭当事人之间的合意即告成立。
第二条出自《法学汇撰》，意思是；在口头约定和其他合同中，我们始终遵循当事人之间的合意。
这两条都体现了罗马法中的契约自由思想

Nexon

The Roman Law of the Twelve Copper Tables

The parties to the transaction in person

Prescribed set of words

Five witnesses and a scale

Next I will explain the development of the idea of freedom of contract in Roman law
The idea of freedom of contract did not exist in the early days of Roman society. The term used to denote ‘contract’ in the Roman Law of the Twelve Copper Tables was called Nexon, which originally meant a transaction accompanied by a piece of copper and a weighing instrument. Nexon this form of contract requirements are very strict, not only require the parties to the transaction in person, say the prescribed set of words, to fulfil the delivery of the copper sheet of the formalities, but also need to have five witnesses and a scale to testify to the presence of the transaction to be valid.

接下来我将讲解罗马法中契约自由思想的发展历程

罗马社会早期并无契约自由的观念。在罗马《十二铜表法》中用来表示“契约”的名词称为耐克逊，它的本意是指伴有铜片和衡具的交易行为。耐克逊这种契约形式要求十分严格，不仅要求交易当事人亲自到场，说出规定的套语，履行铜片的交付手续，而且需有五位证人和一位司秤到场作证，交易方为有效。

 The form of contracting

The consent of the parties

Not only is the ceremony of equal importance to the promise itself, the ceremony is even more important than the promise.

Expression of the same words

As we can see from the initial emergence of the concept of contract, the early Nexus form was characterised by an emphasis on the form of contracting over the consent of the parties. ‘Not only is the ceremony of equal importance to the promise itself, the ceremony is even more important than the promise.’ The effective establishment of Nexon, although also requires the parties present to both parties in the expression of the same words, but this fixed set of words do not necessarily reflect the true meaning of the parties

从契约概念的最初产生中我们可以看出，早期的耐克逊形式具有重缔约形式、轻当事人合意的特点。“仪式不但和允约本身有同样的重要性，仪式甚至比允约更为重要”。耐克逊的有效成立，虽然也要求到场的当事人双方在言辞表达上一致，但这种固定套语式的言辞不一定反映了当事人的真实意思

Roman civil law

Oral contract
Instrumental contract
Contract in kind
Contract of promise

The most prominent embodiment of the freedom of contract

× Any form

Meaning of the elements

The formation of the idea of freedom of contract should be attributed to the development of Roman civil law: the contract of Roman law has experienced four forms: oral contract, instrumental contract, contract in kind and contract of promise. Although these four kinds of contract need the consent of the parties, but the consent in these four kinds of contract in the status is not exactly the same.

Among them, the **contract of promise** is the most prominent embodiment of the freedom of contract. Because the establishment of the contract does not need any form, only to the agreement between the parties for the meaning of the elements, the contract can only be cancelled with the consent of both parties.

契约自由思想的形成应当归功于罗马万民法的发展：罗马法的契约先后经历了**口头契约、文书契约、要物契约和诺成契约**四种形式。虽然这四种契约都需要当事人间的合意，但合意在这四种契约中所处的地位并不完全相同。其中诺成契约最为突出地体现了契约自由。因为诺成契约的成立无需任何形式，仅以当事人间的意思一致为要件，诺成契约也只有在征得双方当事人同意后方可解除。

---

Consent of the parties to each other

The only determining factor

The establishment of the contract depends on the will of the parties, the effect of the debt of the contract comes from the parties

In short, in a promissory contract, all forms of contracting are omitted, and the consent of the parties to each other becomes the only determining factor in the formation of the contract, and the validity of the contract depends entirely on the consent of the parties, and has nothing to do with the form of contracting. At this time the principle of freedom of contract took shape: the establishment of the contract depends on the will of the parties, the effect of the debt of the contract comes from the parties

简而言之，在诺成契约中，缔约的一切形式都被省略了，**当事人间的合意**成为契约成立的唯一决定性因素，契约的效力完全取决于当事人的合意，而与缔约形式无关。这时候契约自由原则初现雏形：契约的成立与否取决于当事人的意志，契约之债的效力来源于当事人





Justinian's Ladder of Jurisprudence, speaking of promissory contracts, states: ‘In the case of contracts of sale, lease, partnership, appointment, etc., the debt is created by the consent of the parties. The assertion that the conclusion of the debts of the above kinds of contracts requires only the consent of the parties is due to the fact that neither an instrument nor the presence of the parties is necessary for their conclusion; moreover, it is not necessary that something should be given, but only that the party who performs the legal act should consent.’

查士丁尼的《法学阶梯》在谈到诺成契约时指出:“关于买卖、租赁、合伙、委任等契约，债务以当事人的同意而成立。上列各种契约，其债务的缔结只需双方当事人的同意的说法，乃是因为其缔结既不需要用文书，也不需要当事人在场;此外，也没有必要给予某物，只要进行该法律行为的当事人同意即可。”
