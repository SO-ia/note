Thinking as a Hobby

William Golding

While I was still a boy, I came to the conclusion that there were three grades of thinking; and that I myself could not think at all.

It was the headmaster of my grammar school who first brought the subject of thinking before me. He had some statuettes in his study. They stood on a high cupboard behind his desk. One was a lady wearing nothing but a bath towel. She seemed frozen in an eternal panic lest the bath towel slip down any farther; and since she had no arms, she was in an unfortunate position to pull the towel up again. Next to her, crouched the statuette of a leopard, ready to spring down at the top drawer of a filing cabinet. Beyond the leopard was a naked, muscular gentleman, who sat, looking down, with his chin on his fist and his elbow on his knee. He seemed utterly miserable.

Some time later, I learned about these statuettes. ThLe headmaster had placed them where they would face delinquent children, because they symbolized to him the whole of life. The naked lady was Venus. She was Love. She was not worried about the towel. She was just busy being beautiful. The leopard was Nature, and he was being natural. The muscular gentleman was not miserable. He was Rodin's Thinker, an image of pure thought.

I had better explain that I was a frequent visitor to the headmaster's study, because of the latest thing I had done or left undone. As we now say, I was not integrated. I was, if anything, disintegrated. Whenever I found myself in a penal position before the headmaster's desk I would sink my head, and writhe one shoe over the other.

The headmaster would look at me and say,

"What are we going to do with you?"

Well, what were they going to do with me? I would writhe my shoe some more and stare down at the worn rug.

"Look up, boy! Can't you look up?"

Then I would look up at the cupboard, where the naked lady was frozen in her panic and the muscular gentleman contemplated the hindquarters of the leopard in endless gloom. I had nothing to say to the headmaster. His spectacles caught the light so that you could see nothing human behind them. There was no possibility of communication.

"Don't you ever think at all?"

No, I didn't think, wasn't thinking, couldn't think—I was simply waiting in anguish for the interview to stop.

"Then you'd better learn—hadn't you?"

On one occasion the headmaster leaped to his feet, reached up and put Rodin's masterpiece on the desk before me.

"That's what a man looks like when he' really thinking."

Clearly there was something missing in me. Nature had endowed the rest of the human race with a sixth sense and left me out. But like someone born deaf, but bitterly determined to find out about sound, I began to watch my teachers to find out about thought.

There was Mr Houghton. He was always telling me to think. With a modest satisfaction, he would tell me that he had thought a bit himself. Then why did he spend so much time drinking? Or was there more sense in drinking than there appeared to be? But if not, and if drinking were in fact ruinous to health—and Mr Houghton was ruined, there was no doubt about that—why was he always talking about the clean life and the virtues of fresh air?

Sometimes, exalted by his own oratory, he would leap from his desk and hustle us outside into a hideous wind.

"Now, boys! Deep breaths! Feel it right down inside you—huge draughts of God's good air!"

He would stand before us, put his hands on his waist and take a tremendous breath. You could hear the wind, trapped in his chest and struggling with all the unnatural impediments. His body would reel with shock and his face go white at the unaccustomed visitation. He would stagger back to his desk and collapse there, useless for the rest of the morning.

Mr Houghton was given to high-minded monologues about the good life, sexless and full of duty. Yet in the middle of these monologues, if a girl passed the window, his neck would turn of itself and he would watch her out of sight. In this instance, he seemed to me ruled not by thought but by an invisible and irresistible spring in his neck.

His neck was an object of great interest to me. Normally it bulged a bit over his collar. But Mr Houghton had fought in the First World War alongside Americans and French, and had come to a settled detestation of both countries. If either happened to be prominent in current affairs, no argument could make Mr Houghton think well of it. He would bang the desk, his neck would bulge still further and go red. "You can say what you like," he would cry, "but I've thought about this—and I know what I think!"

Mr Houghton thought with his neck.

This was my introduction to the nature of what is commonly called thought. Through him I discovered that thought is often full of unconscious prejudice, ignorance and hypocrisy. It will lecture on disinterested purity while its neck is being remorselessly twisted toward a skirt. Technically, it is about as proficient as most businessmen's golf, as honest as most politicians' intentions, or as coherent as most books that get written. It is what I came to call grade-three thinking, though more properly, it is feeling, rather than thought.

我对人们通常所说的思考的了解就是这样开始的。通过霍顿先生，我发现这种思考往往充满 偏见、无知和虚伪。它一面讲什么无私无欲的纯洁，而同时脖子却转向姑娘的石榴裙。从技 术上来说，这种思考的水平就如大多数商界人士的高尔夫球技术一样高，如大多数政客的意 图一样真诚，如大多数创作的书一样条理清楚。这就是我所谓的三级思考，虽然更确切地说， 它只能算作情绪的表示，而不能算作思考

True, often there is a kind of **innocence** in **prejudices**, but in those days I viewed grade-three thinking with contempt and mockery. I delighted to confront a pious lady who hated the Germans with the proposition that we should love our enemies. She taught me a great truth in dealing with grade-three thinkers; because of her, I no longer dismiss lightly a mental process which for nine tenths of the population is the nearest they will ever get to thought. They have immense solidarity. We had better respect them, for we are outnumbered and surrounded. A crowd of **grade-three thinkers**, all shouting the same thing, all warming their hands at the fire of their own prejudices, will not thank you for pointing out the contradictions in their beliefs. Man enjoys agreement as cows will graze all the same way on the side of a hill.

的确，偏见中往往含有一种天真幼稚的成分。但是我那时对三级思考总采取鄙视和嘲讽的态度。有一位太太是虔诚的教徒。她特别憎恨德国人。我就得意地当面顶撞她，对她说，我们不是应该爱我们的敌人吗？这位太太教了我一个和三级思考者交往的伟大真理：由于她，我不再轻视这种占人口百分之九十的人所使用的思考方式，因为这是他们一生能够达到的与思想最接近的地步。三级思考者非常团结。我们寡不敌众，处在他们的重重包围之中。所以我 们最好尊重他们。如果有一群三级思考者，叫着同样的口号，就像共同在炉火上烤手一样惬 意地分享他们的偏见，他们就决不会因为你指出他们观念中的矛盾而对你表示感激。人生来 就喜欢一致，就如同奶牛总是都顺着一面山坡吃草一样。

Grade-two thinking is the detection of contradictions. Grade-two thinkers do not stampede easily, though often they fall into the other fault and lag behind. Grade-two thinking is a withdrawal, with eyes and ears open. It destroys without having the power to create. It set me watching the crowds cheering His Majesty the King and asking myself what all the fuss was about, without giving me anything positive to put in the place of that heady patriotism. But there were compensations. To hear people justify their habit of hunting foxes by claiming that the foxes liked it. To hear our Prime Minister talk about the great benefit we conferred on India by jailing people like Nehru and Gandhi. To hear American politicians talk about peace and refuse to join the League of Nations. Yes, there were moments of delight.

But I was growing toward adolescence and had to admit that Mr Houghton was not the only one with an irresistible spring in his neck. I, too, felt the compulsive hand of nature and began to find that pointing out contradiction could be costly as well as fun. There was Ruth, for example, a serious and attractive girl. I was an atheist at the time. And she was a Methodist. But, alas, instead of relying on the Holy Spirit to convert me, Ruth was foolish enough to open her pretty mouth in argument. She claimed that the Bible was literally inspired. I countered by saying that the Catholics believed in the literal inspiration of Saint Jerome's Vulgate, and the two books were different. Argument flagged.

At last she remarked that there were an awful lot of Methodists, and they couldn't be wrong, could they—not all those millions? That was too easy, said I restively (for the nearer you were to Ruth, the nicer she was to be near to) since there were more Roman Catholics than Methodists anyway; and they couldn't be wrong, could they—not all those hundreds of millions? An awful flicker of doubt appeared in her eyes. I slid my arm around her waist and murmured that if we were counting heads, the Buddhists were the boys for my money. She fled. The combination of my arm and those countless Buddhists was too much for her.

That night her father visited my father and left, red-cheeked and indignant. I was given the third degree to find out what had happened. I lost Ruth, and gained an undeserved reputation as a potential libertine.

Grade-two thinking, though it filled life with fun and excitement, did not make for content. To find out the deficiencies of our elders satisfies the young ego but does not make for personal security. It took the swimmer some distance from the shore and left him there, out of his depth. A typical grade-two thinker will say, "What is truth?" There is still a higher grade of thought which says, "What is truth?" and sets out to find it.

But these grade-one thinkers were few and far between. They did not visit my grammar school in the flesh though they were there in books. I aspired to them, because I now saw my hobby as an unsatisfactory thing if it went no further. If you set out to climb a mountain, however high you climb, you have failed if you cannot reach the top.

I therefore decided that I would be a grade-one thinker. I was irreverent at the best of times. Political and religious systems, social customs, loyalties and traditions, they all came tumbling down like so many rotten apples off a tree. I came up in the end with what must always remain the justification for grade-one thinking. I devised a coherent system for living. It was a moral system, which was wholly logical. Of course, as I readily admitted, conversion of the world to my way of thinking might be difficult, since my system did away with a number of trifles, such as big business, centralized government, armies, marriage...

It was Ruth all over again. I had some very good friends who stood by me, and still do. But my acquaintances vanished, taking the girls with them. Young people seemed oddly contented with the world as it was. A young navy officer got as red-necked as Mr Houghton when I proposed a world without any battleships in it.

Had the game gone too far? In those prewar days, I stood to lose a great deal, for the sake of a hobby.

Now you are expecting me to describe how I saw the folly of my ways and came back to the warm nest, where prejudices are called loyalties, pointless actions are turned into customs by repetition, and we are content to say we think when all we do is feel.

But you would be wrong. I dropped my hobby and turned professional.

If I were to go back to the headmaster's study and find the dusty statuettes still there, I would arrange them differently. I would dust Venus and put her aside, for I have come to love her and know her for the fair thing she is. But I would put the Thinker, sunk in his desperate thought, where there were shadows before him -- and at his back, I would put the leopard, crouched and ready to spring.

如果我还回到校长室里而那些雕像还在那里,我会重新安排它们的位置。我会掸掉维纳斯身上的灰尘,因为我已经了解她美好的本质,开始喜爱她了。但是我会把陷入沉思的思考者放到背光的位置,而在他身后,放上那头蜷伏着准备扑上来的美洲豹。

1.1 genres

A blockbuster is a film genre characterized by spectacle, high-concept premises, huge commercial success, large-scale production, and significant cultural impact. These films often involve massive financial investments and stand out due to their box-office performance and influence within the industry. The 1990s marked the peak of this genre. Not only did blockbusters dominate financially, but they also frequently reinvented storytelling and film techniques. For instance, The Matrix introduced the iconic and now‑famous “bullet-time” effect and epitomized this model while redefining their respective genres.

1.2

The story of The Matrix begins in a future controlled by machines where humans live unknowingly inside a simulated reality called "The Matrix." Neo, a disillusioned programmer, senses that something is wrong with the world. Led by Morpheus, he discovers the truth and begins his journey of training and rebellion. Alongside Trinity and other comrades, Neo battles against machine agents, especially Agent Smith. Through these struggles, he grows and ultimately discovers his true potential, bringing new hope to the human resistance. With employing high-concept narrative, this film integrates dazzling visual effects with philosophical depth, examining the nature of reality, freedom, and human identity.
Produced on a budget of roughly 65 million, The Matrix went on to earn roughly $460 million worldwide, making it Warner Bros.’ top earner of 1999.

Set in the early Qing Dynasty, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon follows Li Mu Bai, a famed swordsman ready to retire, as he entrusts his legendary sword, the Green Destiny, to his friend Yu Shu Lien. However, Jen Yu, a nobleman's rebellious daughter, steals the sword, embarking on a journey in search of freedom and martial adventure. Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lien pursue her, leading to a series of dramatic encounters and philosophical dilemmas. Meanwhile, Jen Yu and Lo Pei’s love story unfolds amidst the chaos. As tensions in the martial world rise, characters are forced to confront their desires, loyalties, and destinies. The story culminates in Jen Yu’s daring leap from Wudang Mountain and Li Mu Bai’s tragic demise, offering a poignant meditation on love, sacrifice, and the code of the martial hero.
Though made on a modest 17 million budget, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon grossed over 213 million worldwide and transcended its wuxia roots to become a global blockbuster.

2.1

Neo functions as the quintessential Hero archetype with his journey follows the traditional path of transformation. At first, he is motivated by a strong desire, triggered by Trinity to uncover the truth under the Matrix. Trinity's cryptic message interrupts Neo’s ordinary life and sparks his curiosity. This call to adventure propels him toward Morpheus, the Mentor who trains Neo in combat and philosophy, symbolizing the self-awareness that challenges him to "free his mind." Neo’s growth is tested by Threshold Guardians, especially anonymous Agents who force him to face up with physical and mental doubt. His ultimate battle with Agent Smith, the Shadow, externalizes Neo’s deepest repressed fears of powerlessness. When Smith tells him, "You are my opposite, my enemy," he is mirroring Neo’s internal struggle. The Hero’s arc culminates in sacrificial rebirth, that is Neo’s "death" and resurrection, confirming his identity as "the One" and shifting from confusion and doubt to strength and clarity.

Morpheus fully embodies the Mentor archetype with clarity. His dramatic function focuses on guiding Neo’s awakening. One of the most powerful moments is when he offers Neo the choice between the red pill and the blue pill.  This moment is similar to a Herald’s call because it forces Neo to choose truth over illusion. His famous line, "Free your mind", reflects this.  His mentorship peaks during his capture by Agents, emphasizing the Mentor’s role in sacrificing safety for the Hero’s growth.

Trinity combines two archetypes: the Herald and the shapeshifter, adding ambiguity that grows into loyalty. At first, she acts as the Herald by giving Neo his call to adventure. Later, her shapeshifter side emerges. She’s an mysterious hacker myth and a devoted warrior shown in fight scenes where she moves with grace while Neo is clumsy. Her romance with Neo aids but also distracts him which is a typical shapeshifter trait.

Agent Smith is the clearest example of the Shadow archetype as the antagonistic force embodying systemic oppression. He is the main force opposing Neo. Smith represents the dark side of the system which is order, control, and emotionless authority.  Smith’s dialogue ("You hear that, Mr. Anderson? That is the sound of inevitability") mirror Neo’s fear that he cannot change anything. Smith is cold, mechanical, and relentless. His appearance and behavior directly contrast Neo’s growth and humanity. Hugo Weaving’s controlled, robotic performance highlights Smith’s role as the embodiment of Neo’s inner and outer conflicts.

2.2

Li Mu Bai embodies the Hero archetype, with seeking to retire from the martial world outwardly and longing for spiritual peace inwardly. His journey is marked by sacrifice surrendering the Green Destiny sword symbolizes relinquishing power. Yet when he encounters Yu Jiaolong, hidden desires resurface and breaking his stoic appearance. This inner conflict comes to a head when he gives his life to save her from poisoned needles. His death and his parting words to Yu Shu Lien reconcile his ego with his “higher self,” completing his transformative journey through final sacrifice.

Jen Yu represents the Shapeshifter who changes among roles of aristocratic daughter, rogue fighter and reluctant student. Stealing the Green Destiny sword is not only an act of rebellion against patriarchal norms, but also a way to manipulate her mentors. Her fighting style, which combines Northern Leg’s force with Southern Fist’s elegance, mirrors her shifting identity. When she challenges Li Mu Bai, “Take the sword or take me?” she highlights erotic tension and unsettles his resolve. Finally, her leap from Wudang Mountain leaves us wondering if she has found freedom or surrendered to fate, leaving her true nature unresolved.

Jade Fox serves as the Shadow. She represents repressed female rage and the darkest side of a rigid Confucian society. Denied official training because of her gender, she takes revenge by poisoning Li Mu Bai’s master. In mentoring, and then betraying, Jen Yu, she externalizes the “traumatic memories” the Hero must surmount. Her defeat at Li Mu Bai’s hands is more than a physical victory. It symbolizes the destruction of the toxic legacy that strangles women’s autonomy.

Lo Pei appears as the Herald. His tales of desert freedom awaken Jen Yu’s desire for independence and disrupted her aristocratic life. By returning during her betrothal, he reignites her rebellion and directly prompts the sword’s theft. Although his screen time fades after Act I, his influence endures who remains the catalyst for Jen Yu’s rejection of societal constraints.

2.3

The Matrix opens with a hook showcasing Trinity dramatically escaping agents by using the striking "bullet‑time" effect. This raises the central question: “What is the Matrix?” and immediately sets the cyberpunk style. The inciting incident comes when Neo receives Trinity’s message, shaking up his normal routine as Thomas Anderson. The interrogation by Agent Smith, where Neo’s mouth seals shut, adds to his growing doubt about reality. Then Neo takes the red pill from Morpheus, rejecting illusion and entering the real world. This marks the start of his mission which is to free humanity. Act I ends powerfully with Neo being reborn in a pod but there is no going back now.

In this act, Neo’s internal and external conflicts was intensified. The point of no return arrives at the Oracle’s visit. She told Neo he is “not the One,” but still must choose to sacrifice himself to save Morpheus. This forces him to face his doubts while the stakes rise that his crew is in danger. Meanwhile, the growing attraction between Trinity and Neo adds emotional complexity. The second turning point hits when Morpheus is captured because of Cypher’s betrayal. Neo, defying all logic, returns to the Matrix despite warnings. He then confronts Agent Smith and is seemingly killed setting the stage for his transformation.

The climax unfolds as Neo is resurrected and Trinity’s love literally brings him back. He awakened as “the One” and stops bullets in mid-air and Smith, and even absorbs Smith’s code. His phone call resolves the central conflict. The denouement is short but iconic: Neo flies into the sky, showing humans can now control the Matrix. The final image echoes the opening code sequence, but now under human influence. This ending emphasizes Neo’s complete transformation and the new balance between man and machine.

2.4

The story begins with the Green Destiny sword at Iron Armor Manor. Its introduction acts as a “MacGuffin,” driving every character’s actions. The sword, an heirloom of 400 years, symbolizes martial honor and immediately draws us in. Iron Armor’s line, “A sword by itself rules nothing,” sets up the film’s main theme: power versus discipline. Jen Yu, masked and daring, steals the blade during a midnight raid being the inciting incident. Her theft shatters the wuxia world’s balance and pushes Yu Shu Lien into chase mode. Jen’s rebellion against her noble life is clear. By the turning point at the 30 minute mark, Jen flouts skilled warriors in a teahouse brawl and proudly declares, she is the invincible sword genius, forcing Li Mubai to step back into the fray. Now he must both retrieve the sword and mentor Jen, setting the stage for his goals.

Conflict intensifies through parallel storylines. At about 60 minutes in the film, Jen shuns Li Mubai’s guidance in the bamboo forest, hurling at him that he is just a man. She then runs off with her outlaw lover, Lo “Dark Cloud.” This point of no return isolates her from moral direction and stokes her inner battle of freedom versus duty. A 20‑minute flashback reveals her history with Lo, showing her rebellion as a response to strict social rules. The plot thickens when Lo crashes Jen’s wedding, prompting her second escape with the sword. Then at the second turning point, around 90 minutes, Jade Fox ambushes Li Mubai and poisons him. Jen sees that her deal with Fox has backfired, filling her with guilt and marking a dramatic low in her life.

Act III (90–120 min) centers on sacrifice and resolution. Li Mu Bai defeats Jade Fox but dies from the poison, confessing, “I would rather be a ghost beside you than enter heaven without you,” which resolves his love for Shu Lien and his duty. Jen kills Fox, but remains spiritually adrift. Shu Lien restores order by returning the sword to Iron Armor and sends Jen to Wudang Mountain. The final freeze‑frame on Jen’s leap echoes Lo’s legend of faith‑testing jumps and leaves her fate open. Shu Lien’s last words—“Whatever path you take in this life, you must be sincere”—bring us back to the opening theme, reminding us that true mastery depends not on a sword, but on inner integrity.

3.1 Similarities

Both The Matrix and Crouching Tiger shook up their genres and reached huge worldwide audiences. The Matrix mixed cyberpunk with Hong Kong action to create “bullet‑time,” showing reality as fluid and unreal. Crouching Tiger fused classic wuxia with Hollywood storytelling, using wirework to highlight its deeper themes. The Matrix made about 460 million globally, while Crouching Tiger won four Oscars and took in 213 million, proofing they broke past niche markets into true phenomena.

Both movies ask that how free are we under unseen powers? The Matrix shows humans trapped as batteries, slaves to machines, and Neo’s awakening questions modern tech’s control. Crouching Tiger sets Confucian duty against Jen Yu’s desert romance, symbolizing order versus desire. The Green Destiny sword is like the Matrix itself which is both a tool of power and a trigger for chaos. Each ending leaves us thinking: is true freedom even possible?

They blend storytelling styles from East and West. The Matrix follows a clear three‑act structure but layers in Baudrillard’s idea of simulacra to question reality. Crouching Tiger weaves Li Mu Bai’s quest with Jen Yu’s desert flashbacks, mirroring Chinese circular narratives. In both, we learn truths alongside the hero—restricted narration keeps us guessing until the end.

3.2 differences

The two films diverge deeply in cultural roots and creative purpose. The Matrix feels like a global tech mash‑up. It borrows Eastern martial arts moves and anime style to build a cyberpunk world. Its signature “bullet‑time” effect serves pure spectacle, not cultural meaning. By contrast, Crouching Tiger springs from cultural preservation. Ang Lee stitches Beijing Opera’s grace and Confucian‑Taoist ethics right into the story. Every fight that flies through the air, like Jennifer’s struggles high in the sky, is a metaphor. Movement itself shows the characters’ inner battles, not just flashy stunt work. In short, The Matrix repurposes Eastern elements for a techno‑Western rebellion, while Crouching Tiger reclaims heritage to deepen universal emotion.

They also treat freedom in opposite ways. The Matrix is all about breaking digital cage. It blends Baudrillard’s simulacra with Eastern spiritual hints, but ultimately champions radical individualism—freedom means destroying the system. Crouching Tiger sees constraint as the path to transcendence. Its heroes juggle duty (Li Mu Bai’s self‑sacrifice), hidden desire (Shu Lien’s quiet love), and defiance (Jen Yu’s bold skill). Nature itself echoes their inner tension. Jen’s climactic leap from Wudang isn’t an escape—it’s acceptance. Where The Matrix equates freedom with system collapse, Crouching Tiger finds liberation in ethical harmony that autonomy through rupture rather than transcendence through balance.

Watching these two films landed the same gut‑punch: freedom isn’t handed to you, you snatch it by rebelling—whether it’s against soulless machines or centuries‑old rules. The Matrix clamps you in digital claustrophobia, that green‑code haze buzzing like exam panic when you didn’t study. Neo’s final fight with Agent Smith? Total release for anyone who’s ever rage‑quit a system. Then Crouching Tiger flows over you like ink on silk which is slower, sadder, but just as fierce. Jen Yu’s leap from Wudang isn’t surrender; it’s the ultimate mic‑drop to a society that tried to cage her in silk and duty. Li Mu Bai choosing honor over love hits harder than any kung fu kick.

Both movies weaponize spectacle to tackle big questions: What walls are we trapped behind, campus rules, family expectations, inner reluctance to be mediocre? They don’t give you freedom, only hand a mirror.

##### Similarities Between *The Matrix* and *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon*  

**1. Genre Innovation and Global Resonance**  

Both films revolutionized their respective genres while achieving unprecedented global impact. *The Matrix* redefined sci-fi by merging cyberpunk aesthetics with Hong Kong action cinema, creating the iconic "bullet-time" visual language that symbolized the fluidity between reality and illusion . Similarly, *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon* transformed wuxia by blending traditional Chinese martial arts with Western narrative structures, using gravity-defying wirework to convey emotional and philosophical depth . Their cross-cultural appeal—*The Matrix* earned 460 million globally, while *Crouching Tiger* won four Oscars and grossed ​213 million—demonstrates how both transcended niche audiences to become cultural phenomena .  

**2. Archetypal Character Journeys**  

Neo and Jen Yu (玉娇龙) embody the **Hero’s Journey** archetype but through distinct cultural lenses. Neo evolves from Thomas Anderson, a disoriented hacker, to "the One" by embracing self-sacrifice and confronting his Shadow (Agent Smith), mirroring Vogler’s model of ego integration . Jen Yu’s arc parallels this: her theft of the Green Destiny sword represents rebellion against Confucian patriarchy, and her training under Li Mu Bai reflects the Mentor-protagonist dynamic. Both characters’ growth is "predicated on sacrifice"—Neo’s physical death and rebirth, Jen Yu’s leap from Wudang Mountain—symbolizing liberation from oppressive systems (AI vs. feudal norms) . Additionally, Trinity and Yu Shu Lien (俞秀莲) serve as **Mirror Characters**, balancing action prowess with emotional loyalty to the protagonists .  

**3. Thematic Exploration of Freedom and Control**  

Both films interrogate **individual autonomy versus systemic constraints**. *The Matrix* frames reality as a digital prison, where humans are "batteries" controlled by machines; Neo’s awakening critiques technological domination and the illusion of choice in modern society . *Crouching Tiger* explores parallel tensions through Confucian ethics: Li Mu Bai’s restraint symbolizes societal duty, while Jen Yu’s desert romance with Lo (罗小虎) embodies untamed desire. The Green Destiny sword becomes a metaphor for power’s duality—it enforces order yet incites chaos—paralleling the Matrix’s dual role as both prison and battleground . Both narratives conclude ambiguously: Neo’s flight suggests ongoing resistance, while Jen Yu’s frozen mid-air leap questions whether freedom lies in life or oblivion .  

**4. Visual Spectacle as Narrative Language**  

Their action sequences transcend physicality to express psychological and philosophical conflicts. *The Matrix*’s "bullet-time" effects visualize Neo’s cognitive liberation, with slow-motion bullets representing shattered illusions of control . In *Crouching Tiger*, the bamboo forest duel between Li Mu Bai and Jen Yu uses balletic wirework to symbolize ethical tension—Li’s grounded poise contrasts Jen’s erratic leaps, reflecting Confucian stability versus youthful rebellion . Both films employ **color symbolism**: *The Matrix*’s green-tinted digital rain signifies artificiality, while *Crouching Tiger*’s desert blues and jade hues evoke cultural polarity (restraint vs. passion) .  

**5. Hybrid Narrative Structures**  

While differing in form, both films fuse Eastern and Western storytelling conventions. *The Matrix* adopts the **Classic Three-Act Structure** (Setup/Confrontation/Resolution) but infuses it with Jean Baudrillard’s philosophy of simulacra, using linear progression to deconstruct linear reality . *Crouching Tiger* employs **multi-linear narration**, intertwining Li Mu Bai’s quest for peace with Jen Yu’s desert flashbacks—a technique echoing Chinese literary "circular repetition" while advancing thematic cohesion . Both use **restricted narration**: audiences discover the Matrix’s truth alongside Neo, just as Jen Yu’s stolen sword slowly reveals her conflicted loyalties .  

**6. Cultural Syncretism in Sound and Symbolism**  

Music and symbolism bridge cultural divides. Composer Tan Dun’s score for *Crouching Tiger* merges Erhu solos with Western orchestration, mirroring the film’s East-West duality; the track "Sorrow" underscores Li Mu Bai’s death with cello melodies that "weep" like Confucian lament . Similarly, *The Matrix*’s electronic soundtrack by Don Davis integrates Buddhist chants ("Navras") during Neo’s enlightenment, fusing techno-utopianism with spiritual transcendence . The films’ titles themselves are symbolic: "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" alludes to concealed talent (虎落平阳), while "The Matrix" evokes Plato’s cave—both hinting at hidden truths beneath surface realities .  

**Conclusion: Universality in Dichotomy**  

Despite stylistic contrasts, both films expose the **human struggle against invisible cages**—whether digital, societal, or psychological. Their shared resonance lies in framing resistance as a synthesis of opposites: Neo integrates human intuition with machine logic, while Jen Yu’s leap merges rebellion with redemption. As scholar Wang Ti-Yun notes, such binaries (e.g., East/West, freedom/control) reflect structuralist tensions inherent in globalized narratives . Ultimately, both masterpieces prove that profound storytelling transcends genre, using spectacle to ask timeless questions about identity and autonomy.





##### 2.2 Character Archetype Analysis of *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon*  

**Li Mu Bai as the HERO**  

Li Mu Bai epitomizes Vogler’s **Hero archetype**, driven by an outer motivation to retire from the martial world and an inner quest for spiritual peace. His journey is marked by sacrifice—surrendering the Green Destiny sword symbolizes relinquishing power, yet his encounter with Yu Jiaolong (Jen Yu) ignites repressed desire, fracturing his stoic facade . This conflict peaks when he sacrifices himself to save her from poisoned needles, a literal and metaphorical surrender to his "unacknowledged aspects" (Vogler’s psychological function). His final confession of love to Yu Xiulian (俞秀莲) reconciles his ego with his "higher self," completing the Hero’s transformative arc through death .  

**Yu Jiaolong (Jen Yu) as the SHAPESHIFTER**  

Jen Yu embodies the **Shapeshifter archetype** through her fluid identities: aristocratic bride, rogue warrior, and disciple. Her theft of the Green Destiny sword is both a rebellion against patriarchal constraints and a deceptive lure to manipulate Li Mu Bai and Yu Xiulian . Physically, her fighting style—blending Northern Leg’s aggression with Southern Fist’s grace—mirrors her psychological duality. Her infamous challenge to Li Mu Bai ("Take the sword or take me?") exploits erotic tension, destabilizing his resolve and fulfilling the Shapeshifter’s role in creating narrative uncertainty . Her ambiguous leap from Wudang Mountain ultimately questions whether her transformation signifies freedom or resignation, leaving her archetype unresolved .  

**Jade Fox (碧眼狐狸) as the SHADOW**  

Jade Fox personifies the **Shadow archetype**, representing systemic oppression and repressed female rage. As both Jen Yu’s mentor and antagonist, she externalizes the "dark side" of Confucian society: denied mentorship by Li Mu Bai’s master due to her gender, her vengeance manifests as a literal poisoning of patriarchal authority . Her murder of Li’s master and manipulation of Jen Yu reflect Vogler’s concept of the Shadow embodying "traumatic memories" the Hero must confront. Her death during the climactic battle with Li Mu Bai is not merely physical defeat but a symbolic purge of the toxic legacy stifling female agency .  

**Yu Xiulian (俞秀莲) as the MENTOR**  

Though absent from Vogler’s core archetypes, Yu Xiulian functions as a **Mentor** through her embodiment of Confucian duty and emotional restraint. Her dialogues with Jen Yu—urging her to "be true to yourself"—serve as moral guidance, echoing Vogler’s Mentor as the "conscience" . Her unrequited love for Li Mu Bai and stoic acceptance of his attraction to Jen Yu position her as the "higher self" advocating ethical integrity over desire. Her final plea to Jen ("Whatever path you take, be sincere") crystallizes the Mentor’s role in guiding the Hero toward self-awareness .  

Yu Shu Lien takes on the Mentor archetype, though she isn’t part of Vogler’s core five. She embodies Confucian duty and emotional restraint. In advising Jen Yu to “be true to yourself,” she offers moral guidance and acts as the story’s conscience. Her unspoken love for Li Mu Bai and her acceptance of his feelings for Jen Yu illustrate her commitment to integrity over passion. Her final plea that is “Whatever path you choose, be sincere”, cements her role as the Hero’s ethical guide.

**Lo (Dark Cloud) as the HERALD**  

Lo acts as the **Herald** who initiates Jen Yu’s "call to adventure." His tales of desert freedom ("No rules, no disciplines") awaken her longing for autonomy, disrupting her complacent aristocratic life . His reappearance during her betrothal reignites her rebellion, directly triggering her theft of the Green Destiny sword. Though his role diminishes after Act I, his influence persists as the catalyst for Jen Yu’s rejection of societal constraints, fulfilling the Herald’s function as an agent of change .  

**Logical Coherence**  

Each character’s archetype interlinks through the film’s exploration of **desire versus duty**. Li Mu Bai’s Heroic sacrifice resolves his inner conflict but exposes Confucianism’s fragility; Jen Yu’s Shapeshifting defiance challenges patriarchal norms yet culminates in ambiguous liberation; Jade Fox’s Shadow embodies the cost of suppressed agency; Yu Xiulian’s Mentorship underscores ethics amid chaos; and Lo’s Herald role ignites the chain of events. Together, they form a tapestry of "crouching" desires and "hidden" societal chains, reflecting Lee’s critique of rigid traditions .

##### 2.2 Character Archetype Analysis of *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon*

**Li Mu Bai** embodies the **Hero** archetype. Outwardly, he seeks to retire from the martial world. Inwardly, he longs for spiritual peace. Sacrificing the Green Destiny sword symbolizes his attempt to relinquish power. Yet when he encounters Yu Jiaolong (Jen Yu), hidden desires resurface. This inner conflict comes to a head when he gives his life to save her from poisoned needles. His death and his parting words to Yu Shu Lien reconcile his ego with his “higher self,” completing his transformative journey through ultimate sacrifice.

**Jen Yu** represents the **Shapeshifter**. She moves between roles—aristocratic daughter, rogue fighter, reluctant student. Stealing the Green Destiny sword is both an act of rebellion against patriarchal norms and a way to manipulate her mentors. Her fighting style—combining Northern Leg’s force with Southern Fist’s elegance—mirrors her shifting identity. When she taunts Li Mu Bai, “Take the sword or take me?” she heightens erotic tension and unsettles his focus. Finally, her fateful leap from Wudang Mountain leaves us wondering if she has found freedom or surrendered to fate, leaving her true nature ambiguous.

**Jade Fox** serves as the **Shadow**. She channels repressed female rage and the darkest side of a rigid Confucian society. Denied official training because of her gender, she takes vengeance by poisoning Li Mu Bai’s master. In mentoring—and then betraying—Jen Yu, she externalizes the “traumatic memories” the Hero must overcome. Her defeat at Li Mu Bai’s hands is more than a physical victory. It symbolizes the destruction of the toxic legacy that stifles women’s agency.

**Yu Shu Lien** takes on the **Mentor** archetype, though she isn’t part of Vogler’s core five. She embodies Confucian duty and emotional restraint. In advising Jen Yu to “be true to yourself,” she offers moral guidance and acts as the story’s conscience. Her unspoken love for Li Mu Bai and her acceptance of his feelings for Jen Yu illustrate her commitment to integrity over passion. Her final plea—“Whatever path you choose, be sincere”—cements her role as the Hero’s ethical guide.

**Lo Pei** appears as the **Herald**. His tales of desert freedom—“No rules, no disciplines”—awaken Jen Yu’s desire for independence. By returning during her betrothal, he reignites her rebellion and directly prompts the sword’s theft. Although his screen time fades after Act I, his influence endures. He remains the spark that ignites Jen Yu’s journey of self‑discovery.

Together, these archetypes weave the film’s central tension of **desire versus duty**. Li Mu Bai’s Heroic sacrifice lays bare the cost of inner peace. Jen Yu’s Shapeshifting challenges social constraints but leaves her destiny uncertain. Jade Fox’s Shadow shows the price of suppressed anger. Yu Shu Lien’s Mentorship underscores the need for moral balance. And Lo Pei’s Herald role sets change in motion. Their intertwined paths form a rich tapestry of hidden longings and the chains that bind them.

##### 2.3 Analysis of the Classic Three-Act Structure of *The Matrix*  

**Act I: Setup (0-30 mins)** 
*The Matrix* opens with a high-concept hook: Trinity’s gravity-defying escape from police agents, showcasing the revolutionary "bullet-time" effect while posing the film’s key line—"What is the Matrix?" This sequence establishes the film’s cyberpunk aesthetic and central enigma. The inciting incident occurs when Neo receives Trinity’s cryptic message ("The Matrix has you"), disrupting his mundane existence as Thomas Anderson. Agent Smith’s interrogation—where Neo’s mouth seals shut—concretizes his suspicion that reality is illusory. At the turning point (30 mins), Neo chooses the red pill offered by Morpheus, rejecting his former life to pursue truth. This decision physically catapults him into the real world—a post-apocalyptic wasteland where humans are enslaved by machines—and sets his outer motivation: to liberate humanity. The act ends with Neo’s rebirth in a pod, symbolizing his irreversible commitment to the quest.  

The Matrix opens with a hook showcasing Trinity’s gravity-defying escape from agents, employing the revolutionary "bullet-time" effect to pose the film’s central key line: "What is the Matrix?" . This sequence establishes the cyberpunk aesthetic and core enigma of simulated reality. The inciting incident occurs when Neo receives Trinity’s message ("The Matrix has you"), disrupting his mundane existence as Thomas Anderson . Agent Smith’s interrogation—where Neo’s mouth physically seals shut—concretizes his suspicion that reality is illusory, aligning with Lacan’s *Symbolic Order* theory . At the turning point (30 mins), Neo chooses the red pill offered by Morpheus, rejecting his former life to pursue truth. This decision physically catapults him into the real world—a post-apocalyptic wasteland where humans are enslaved by machines—and defines his outer motivation: to liberate humanity . The act ends with Neo’s rebirth in a pod, symbolizing irreversible commitment to his quest.  

**Act II: Development (30-90 mins)** 
This act escalates conflict through training sequences and moral tests. Neo’s point of no return (60 mins) arrives when he fully accepts his potential as "the One" after the Oracle ambiguously declares he is "not the one" but must choose whether to sacrifice himself for Morpheus. This forces Neo to confront his inner conflict—self-doubt versus destiny—while raising stakes through the crew’s vulnerability to Agents. The turning point 2 (90 mins) is Morpheus’ capture by Agent Smith, a catastrophic setback stemming from Cypher’s betrayal. Neo defies logic ("I can’t just sit here!") and re-enters the Matrix for a rescue mission, ignoring Trinity’s warning of "suicide." His confrontation with Smith culminates in apparent defeat: Neo is shot dead, collapsing to the ground as the Oracle’s prophecy seems fulfilled. This "death" becomes the catalyst for his transformation, closing Act II at its darkest moment.  

**Act III: Resolution (90-120 mins)** 
The climax pivots on Neo’s resurrection. Trinity’s kiss—a declaration of love—revives him, triggering his awakening as "the One." In a transcendent display of power, Neo stops bullets mid-air, assimilates Smith’s code, and destroys him from within. His final phone call to the machines—"I’m going to show them a world without you"—resolves the core conflict: Neo embraces his messianic role to dismantle the Matrix. The resolution is sparse but iconic: Neo soars skyward, symbolizing humanity’s reclaimed agency, while green digital rain visualizes the Matrix’s malleability. The narrative closes with absolute change (Neo’s godlike mastery) and circularity—the film begins and ends with code, but now under human control.

The narrative closes with *absolute change* (Neo’s godlike mastery) and *circularity*: the film begins and ends with code, but now under human control.  

##### **2.4 Analysis of the Classic Three-Act Structure of *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon***  

**Act I: Setup (0-30 mins)** 
The film’s **hook** is Li Mu Bai’s arrival in Beijing, surrendering his Green Destiny sword to Yu Shu Lien—an act symbolizing his desire to retire from violence. The **key line**—"A sword by itself rules nothing"—poses the film’s theme: the tension between weaponry and wisdom. The **inciting incident** occurs when Jen Yu steals the sword, exposing her martial prowess and rebellious spirit. Her theft disrupts the wuxia world’s order, forcing Shu Lien to pursue her and revealing Jen’s mentorship under the vengeful Jade Fox. At the **turning point (30 mins)**, Jen publicly humiliates warriors in a teahouse brawl, rejecting Confucian hierarchy ("I am the invincible sword genius!"). This defiance forces Li Mu Bai to abandon retirement and confront Jen, setting his dual motivation: reclaim the sword and redeem Jen’s squandered talent.  

**Act II: Development (30-90 mins)** 
This act deepens through parallel quests: Li and Shu Lien’s pursuit of Jen, and Jen’s desert reunion with her lover, Lo. The **point of no return (60 mins)** arrives when Jen rejects Li’s mentorship atop a bamboo forest ("You’re just a man!"), fleeing to the desert with Lo. This choice heightens her inner conflict—freedom versus responsibility—while isolating her from the moral guidance she needs. Shu Lien’s emotional duel with Jen ("Don’t waste your life for pride!") underscores generational fissures in wuxia ethics. The **turning point 2 (90 mins)** is Jade Fox’s poisoning of Li Mu Bai during a confrontation—a direct consequence of Jen’s alliance with Fox. As Li collapses, Jen realizes her rebellion enabled this betrayal, fracturing her defiance into guilt. The act ends with Li’s life hanging in the balance, and Jen’s path toward redemption or ruin unresolved.  

**Act III: Resolution (90-120 mins)**  
The **climax** centers on sacrifice. Li Mu Bai uses his dying breath to save Jen from Fox’s poisoned needles, confessing his love to Shu Lien before perishing. Jen’s subsequent rage-fueled killing of Fox resolves the vengeance subplot but leaves her spiritually adrift. In the **resolution**, Jen leaps from Wudang Mountain—an ambiguous act echoing Lo’s legend of a wish-granting jump. Her descent (freeze-framed mid-air) refuses narrative closure, instead posing philosophical questions about freedom and atonement. Shu Lien’s final words—"Whatever path you take in this life, be true"—reframe the key line, emphasizing integrity over weaponry. The film closes with circularity: the Green Destiny sword returned to its holder, yet the human cost of its journey forever transforms those who touched it.

##### Revised Analysis of the Classic Three-Act Structure in *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon*  

**Act I: Setup (0–30 min)**  

The film opens with the symbolic introduction of the **Green Destiny Sword** at Iron Armor Manor, establishing its role as a "MacGuffin" that drives the narrative. The **hook** lies in the sword’s presentation—a 400-year-old weapon embodying martial virtue—which immediately captivates both characters and audiences. The **key line**, *"A sword by itself rules nothing"* (spoken by Iron Armor), poses the central theme: the tension between power and moral discipline. The **inciting incident** occurs at 21 minutes (18% runtime) when Jen Yu, disguised as a masked thief, steals the sword during a night raid. This act disrupts the wuxia world’s order and forces Yu Shu Lien into pursuit, revealing Jen’s rebellion against her aristocratic fate . The **turning point** (30 min) follows Jen’s public humiliation of warriors in a teahouse brawl, where she declares, *"I am the invincible sword genius!"* This defiance compels Li Mu Bai—who had initially retired—to abandon his detachment and pursue Jen, setting his dual motivations: reclaim the sword and guide her squandered talent .

**Act II: Development (30–90 min)**  

This act escalates through parallel conflicts. The **point of no return** (60 min) occurs when Jen rejects Li Mu Bai’s mentorship atop a bamboo forest (*"You’re just a man!"*), fleeing to the desert with her lover, Lo "Dark Cloud". This choice isolates Jen from moral guidance and intensifies her inner conflict: romantic freedom versus Confucian duty . A 20-minute flashback (44%–62% runtime) then reveals Jen’s backstory with Lo, contextualizing her rebellion as a response to stifling societal expectations. The narrative complicates further when Lo disrupts Jen’s wedding (74 min), triggering her second flight with the sword . The **turning point 2** (90 min) arrives during Li Mu Bai’s confrontation with Jen, where Jade Fox—Jen’s embittered mentor—poisons Li. Jen realizes her alliance with Fox enabled this betrayal, fracturing her defiance into guilt and marking a catastrophic setback .  

---

**Act III: Resolution (90–120 min)**  

The **climax** centers on sacrifice. At Jade Fox’s lair (104 min), Li Mu Bai defeats Fox but is fatally poisoned. His dying confession of love to Shu Lien (*"I would rather be a ghost drifting by your side than enter heaven without you"*) resolves their repressed romance while affirming his commitment to wuxia duty . Jen’s killing of Fox ends the vengeance subplot but leaves her spiritually adrift. In the **resolution** (112 min), Shu Lien returns the sword to Iron Armor, symbolizing the restoration of order. She then sends Jen to Wudang Mountain to reunite with Lo. The film concludes with Jen’s leap from the mountain (114 min)—a gesture mirroring Lo’s legend of "faith-testing" jumps. Her freeze-framed descent refuses literal closure, instead questioning whether she seeks oblivion, redemption, or transcendence . Shu Lien’s final admonition, *"Whatever path you take in this life, be true,"* reframes the key line, emphasizing that integrity—not the sword—defines true mastery .

Social Drama Film (American Beauty)

Social Drama

Drama is a category comprising serious films that portray realistic characters inconflict with themselves, others, or forces of nature. The category is one of thebroadest, and so the focus here is on one of the most important kinds of drama-thesocial drama.
Much neglected by academic film critics, the social drama nevertheless enjoys considerable currency among scriptwnters and journalistic critics. Social dramas arefilms whose central narrative concern or conflict is a social problem-poverty, inequality, discrimination,racism,or exclusion(排外行为), to name just a few possibilities. The genre has two defining conventions: "identify a social ill; dramatize its remedy".' Classic social dramas include One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest(( AF») (which deals with the mental health system), Philadelphia (about the AIDS epidemic), American History X(which deals with the causes of racism), and Traffic(《毒品网络》)(dealing with drug abuse).
The social problem is usually a contemporary problem and as such the setting is also contemporary. The social drama typically displays a sympathetic perspective towards the victims of this problem, and is supportive of those who crusade (|) against it. Underlying the social drama is the assumption that the problem, once recognized, can be remedied through well-intentioned social, political, or legal reform.
The Handbook of American Film Genresgives a useful definition of what is meant by social problem. A social problem is, first and foremost, an adverse condition affecting a significant number of people. It must, however, also be recognized as a problem, and this is something that can only occur if those concerned about the problem have enough power and influence to bring it to public attention. Finally, there must be a belief that - if the appropriate measures are taken - the problem can be solved. So, for example, films that depict aggressiveness as an inalienable (7 0J) t9) part of human nature would not be classified as social dramas; on the other hand,films showing the pernicious(有害的)effects of the policy of apartheid(种族 隔离) probably would.
Social dramas typically follow the following narrative pattern. The protagonist is initially unaware of the existence of the problem. As the film develops, the protagonist becomes conscious of the problem and becomes committed to fighting against it. The protagonist is helped in this process by a minor character who communicates the true nature of the problem and suggests ways of dealing with it. The problem itself is often embodied in the figure of the antagonist. The protagonist finally confronts the problem, is victorious or defeated, and the film ends.
One of the pitfalls (k) of the social drama is didacticism (i #). The best social dramas avoid this by presenting the social problem from the perspectives of both its victims and its perpetrators ( ), and allowing the conflict to develop dialectically.
Social dramas stem from the most noble and honorable motives. They are attempts to fulfill the ancient dictum (t. a)) that fiction should instruct as well as entertain. They help us to recognize a social issue that we might otherwise overlook, and show us in dramatic form both its possible consequences and its pos- sible solutions. And even if they cannot always do that, they at least in the words of Polish filmmaker Andrzej Wajda help "to tell the audience something, to make people think, to initiate a dialogue".



American Beauty (1999)
American Beauty was the smash hit(非常流行的东西)
of 1999, winning Oscars for best film, best director (Sam Mendes), best screenplay (E) (Alan Ball), best leading actor (Kevin Spacey), and best cinematography. It is often considered to be a depiction of one man's troubled passage through a stereotypical mid-life crisis, and at the same time "an assault on the emotional sleepwalking ((f) that passes for life in the American suburb".2 But it is much more than that: It is also a controversial indictment (#2i/F) of the excesses of feminism, commercialism, and the "me-first" philosophy, a testament to the enduring power of beauty to raise the spirit from its lethargy (昏睡,无生气),and-ultimately-a story of the soul rebounding(弹回)from its self- imposed misery and stagnation (i).
American Beauty is the first foray (JF€lltay it) into cinema of the British theatre director, Sam Mendes. Nearly all the major Hollywood studios shied away from the project; only Stephen Spielberg's company, DreamWorks (# T.J), would take it on. Nevertheless, impressed by the script's potential, Kevin Spacey (playing Lester) and Annette Bening were both willing to work significantly below their normal rates (Brfå, H), and the film was produced at the comparatively low cost of $15 million. Its success came as a surprise to some of those involved. When it came to the preview screenings (f#t), Mendes himself questioned the audience about their feelings towards the film. "So at the end of the film I got up, and I was terribly British, I said, 'So, who kind of liked the movie?' And about a third of them put up their hands and I thought, 'Oh shit.' So I said, 'OK, who kind of didn't like it?' Two people. And I said, 'Well, what else is there?' And a guy in the front said, 'Ask who really liked the movie.' So I did, and they all put up their hands. And I thought, 'Thank you, God."" One of the chief attractions of the film is its engagement ( ..... ftx ) with a host of controversial contemporary issues concerning the concept of masculinity in a post- feminist and post-industrial society. Lester Burnham, played with panache (i"(ift) by Kevin Spacey, is an "Everyman" figure half hero, half wimp (f#sss A) - who is drawn unsuspectingly (te tf i fe) into conflict with those around him who are indignant about his newly-discovered freedom. All this is organized within the tight structure of the classic Hollywood narrative and presented through the lens of an elegiac (Hlk, #etk) cinematog- raphy that couples (i fr) an expressive use of overhead shots and balanced composition with a richly textured visual symbolism.


Synopsis
American Beauty tells the story of Lester Burnham, a middle-aged man who lives a sedated (F t) life with his family in American suburbia (TtiB). One evening he is pressured by his wife Carolyn to attend a performance at their daughter's local school. Participating in the performance is Jane's best friend Angela, an attractive blonde-haired girl. Lester is mesmerized.
Lester's meeting with Angela awakens in him a vitality he has not known for years. With the assistance of his neighbour's son, Ricky Fitts, he begins to rediscover the pleasures of his youth. He quits his meaningless office job and starts smoking marijuana (lfk) again; in flight from the restraints of his marriage, he even turns a blind eye to his wife's infidelity. One night, when Angela comes to stay with Jane in the family home, Lester overhears her say that if he worked out more she would sleep with him. Inspired, he begins his pursuit in earnest. Colonel Fitts misunderstands the relationship between Lester and his son Ricky. Himself a repressed homosexual, he believes that Lester is paying money to his son in exchange for sexual favours. One rainy evening he can resist the temptation no longer. He accosts (3lifs) Lester in his garage, and makes a pass (215|, Rx). Lester is shocked and turns him away. Shortly afterwards, he returns with a gun and shoots Lester in the head. At the moment of his death, Lester finally relives the most beautiful moments of his life, and comes to realize what it is that he has been seeking all along.

Genre
American Beauty can be classified as a "social drama", with the social problem at its heart being the so-called "crisis of masculinity". The idea that Western masculinity is in crisis has been raised and theorized in a number of books published throughout the 1990s. Titles include: Absent Fathers, Lost Sons: The Search for Masculine Identity (1991), Masculinity in Crisis (1994), and Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man (1999). There are two main arguments raised by commentators on the crisis of masculinity. The first is that the nature of work has changed radically in the past century. For the working class, the production-line systems associated with Taylorism and Fordism have led to alienation: Workers have little interaction with fellow workers and almost no contact at all with the finished product. For the middle-class male the situation is similarly dispiriting: In the modern corporation, the role of the male is to sell, to market, to strategize, to  manage-but he is no longer likely to actually make anything. Traditionally, the notion of masculinity has been associated with manufacture and the production of tangible goods; modern man, in contrast, is unable to feel that his labour is being used productively. Men have, according to this argument, lost the sense of "social usefulness" on which their masculinity depended. The second argument is related to the emergence of a consumer and media culture that tends-through its preferred tools of advertising, publicity, and promotion - to attribute value to the superficial. This kind of "ornamental culture" is more congenial ( .6) to women than men, since for historical reasons they have been accustomed to treating themselves as objects of display. For a man, however, it may be profoundly traumatic to have to adapt to a culture in which a premium (fz, ) is put on self-presentation, personal "image", and "looking good". Male cosmetics, men's health clubs and fitness centers, and the idea that one's manhood is expressed by one's car- all are evidence of an increasing culture of display and ornamentation among men.
American Beauty follows the basic model of the social drama to give a vivid depiction of masculinity in crisis and of the victimized and alienated middle-class white male.4 Lester Burnham, trapped in a meaningless office job and an equally meaningless consumer lifestyle, is initially unaware of his own plight. Gradually, and with the aid of the minor character Ricky, he is awakened to the fact that he has the freedom to make choices - and, in particular, the freedom to escape from the empty routine of his work life and to recover a youthfulness that he has lost. The recovery of his youthfulness is at the same time a recovery of his masculinity: He musters the courage both to stand up to (#tt) the "efficiency expert" Brad (who represents the trend towards alienation at work) and to stand up to his wife (who represents what is worst about consumerism and the "ornamental culture"). He reclaims his right to express his masculinity in the form of physicality (working out at home) and sexuality (in his pursuit of Angela). The film leads to its inevitable climax, at which Lester encounters his two main antagonists -his wife Carolyn and his neighbour Colonel Fitts - who together represent the social forces that aim to restrict the free expression of his masculinity.

The Crisis of Masculinity: Consumption
Replaces Production
"In gender studles, it is common to refer to this differentiation as a switch from production (making things) to consumption (making money to go out and buy things). The latter is typically defined as a feminized sphere Traditionally, this is what women are thought to do as part of their gendered role; they shop for their homes and for their omaments, to nurture their families and to prettify their dens and their selves. It follows naturally that a man's location in that sphere is seen as constituting a crisis of identity Hunter, Latham 2003. The Celluloid Cubicle: Regressive Constructions of Masculinity in 1990s Office Movies. The Joumal of American Culture.

Characters
The Protagonists
One useful way of approaching the concept of character is to distinguish between inner and outer motivation. Lester's outer motivation is clear and simple - to seduce Angela. His inner motivation, though, is quite different and much more complicated, and only emerges gradually through the course of the film. It is in this way that the characters hold our interest. As Mendes says, "Every character starts off as if they're going to be one thing but they become another [ ... ] And that's true of the movie as a whole. It gradually spirals (ANE AEt FP#) down to a place that's much darker and much more haunting (4 AE+TH9), poetic and strange- and more emotional too-than we imagine."5 In the first place, Lester is motivated to live freely. When he finally gets proof of his wife's infidelity, his reaction is not anger but relief that she has given him exactly the justification he needs to assert his independence, "You don't get to tell me what to do ever again." Yet the freedom pursued by Lester is not just freedom to do what he wants; it is, more importantly, a freedom from the nonsense that surrounds him, whether in the form of Brad's corporate platitudes(陈词滥调,官腔)or his wife's waffle(唠叨)about"success".Secondly,Lester is motivated to pursue beauty - beauty as Ricky Fitts sees it, which is the beauty that comes from appreciating life in its wholeness. Finally, he is motivated to engage in human contact. Having discovered that Angela is actually a virgin, the two begin to talk, and she asks him how he is. He replies, "It's been a long time since anybody asked me that." In terms of outer motivation Lester has failed, because he has not made love to Angela; in terms of inner motivation, however, his actions have been tremendously successful.

* Forces of Antagonism
American Beauty can, as we have seen, be categorized as a "social problem" drama, and such films often feature an antagonist who embodies not just his own faults but also the "problem" as a whole. Lester's antagonists are the two figures who seek to end his life at the climax-Carolyn and Colonel Fitts-but behind them are the much broader "forces of antagonism" that comprise the social problem as a whole.
Carolyn is Lester's wife but also his principle antagonist, and stands for everything that he has grown to hate. She works in the real estate industry, and is obsessed with (.i fE) property to the extent that when the roots of the neighbours' sycamore (#f) tree grow underneath her lawn she simply cuts the tree down. In fact, Carolyn embodies a whole ideology -- the "me-first" ideology of the self-help tapes she listens to in her car. These tapes promote a simplistic philosophy of so-called "me-centred living", and the motto they encourage their listeners to repeat is "I refuse to be a victim". The essential conflict of the film can thus be seen as not just a conflict between two individuals, but also a conflict between two philosophies. On the one hand is Lester's pursuit of freedom, truth, and intimacy; on the other is the opposed philosophy of living purely for oneself- of selfishness justified by a spurious and fabricated "victimhood". The former ends in death, but also joy; the latter in life, but also misery.
Colonel Fitts is Lester's neighbour and his second antagonist. Once a member of the US Marine Corps, he brings his military values to civilian life - in particular the idea that (as he tells Ricky) "you can't just go around doing whatever you feel like." He is also a violent homophobe(对同性恋的憎恶、恐惧)and arch-conservative(极端保守者)who hates "faggots" and believes that the country is "going to the dogs". Like Carolyn, Colonel Fitts represents the broader forces of antagonism that seek to stifle (il iil) Lester's rediscovered vigour. In this case, however, the forces of antagonism take the shape of an older model of masculinity that is shown by the film to be self-destructive and no longer viable ("JfTH). Colonel Fitts' military ethos recalls the kind of masculinity that can express itself only in the form of physical strength and aggression; his conservatism, based on the idea of maintaining an unworkable and unhappy family, is as damaging to men as it is to women; and his homophobia merely limits the free expression of his own homosexual interests.

“菲茨一家代表了所谓的军事-工业情结。一家之主是已经退伍的空军上校 菲茨,在整个剧本中一直用‘上校’而不是用名字称呼。他给家庭灌输的生活规 范完全是军队的那一套原则:无条件的、无情的自制超越一切,在人与人之间筑起高墙。他的同性恋恐惧症以及他在里基违反规则时暴跳如重的反应就是最好的375 证明。他的邻居伯纳姆一家代表的则是典型的现代价值观。罗伯特·贝拉可能会 说这是‘表达性个人主义’,但是我却将之称为“消费-娱乐情结”。父亲莱斯特 在广告公司工作。母亲卡罗林是乖炭的玛莎·斯图尔特(美国家居时尚电视名人 -- 译者注),在房地产销售业苦苦挣扎,用自助磁带激励自己,并且用物质作 为炫耀成功的象征(意大利丝制椅罩、梅赛德斯SUV):燃烧伯纳姆一家的是欲 望之火 -- 成功的欲望、享乐的欲望、更完美的粉饰外表的欲望。(‘你注意到了 吗,园艺剪的手柄和她干活时穿的木屐相映成趣。’莱斯特提到卡罗林的时候说, 这可不是巧合。’如果菲茨一家代表的是压抑欲望带来的悲剧,那么伯纳姆一家 代表的就是沉溺于欲望的后果。”





叙述
*用三幕式结构分析《美国丽人》
《美国丽人》是经典三幕式电影结构的理想范例,三幕式结构在这部电影得到了 最大的发挥。电影像一曲优美的挽歌,三幕结构在这里并不是一种束缚,而是一个灵 活的框架,在这个框架中探索一系列有趣的思想并且创造出美学效果。 《美国丽人》实际上有两个“引子”:第一个是莱斯特·伯纳姆的女儿简说,她的 父亲是一个废物,她想杀了他;第二个则是莱斯特·伯纳姆自己所说的,他在不到一 年内即将死去。两个引子都能分别引起观众的兴趣。莱斯特·伯纳姆是一个怎样可恨 的人,以至于女儿会盼着他死掉?而且,既然我们已经知道了他真的会死,那么是怎 么死的呢?两个引子联系在一起会进一步激起观众的好奇心;导致莱斯特死亡的是 简,还是别的人?
两个引子之后不久,就是电影的“主要线索”,这个线索引出了整个电影试图探讨的问题。这个线索就是莱斯特所说的:“找回失去的东西永远不会太迟”。整部电影将要探究的,就是一个中年男人醒悟以后是否可以重新拾回青春的乐观和朝气。电影的“引发事件”是莱斯特·伯纳姆第一次看到安古拉。这个美丽的高中女生引发了他的中年危机。这是一个非常经典的引发事件,主要角色的生活轨道被打乱,产生了追求新的目标的动机。在《美国丽人》中这个引发事件正好在第15分钟出现,莱斯特胸中燃起了青春逝去后再也不曾感受过的激情。但是,直到“第一转折点”出现,他都没因为这种激情采取任何具体的行动。第一个转折点就是他和里基·菲茨一起吸大麻、跟安吉拉喝酒,而任由他的妻子和刚勾搭上的情人幽会。从这时开始,他做出了第一个决定性的行动,重新开始充满活力的生活。
莱斯特在第一幕中采取了决定性的行动,但是他真正的义无反顾是在第二幕中间的“不可返回点” -- 和家人吃饭的时候把盘子摔碎;从这一刻开始,他再也不可能和妻子复合,也不可能重新回到旧的生活中。但是,根据经典的三幕结构,主要角色之前采取的行动都有着某种错误,直到第二幕的“第二转折点”他才能够认识到这个错误。《美国丽人》的第二转折点是菜斯特发现安吉拉还是一个处女。因此,他认识到他一直以来寻求的并不是艳遇,而是和一个女人片刻的亲密感。
第三幕最重要的时刻就是“高潮”,这也是整部电影感情的高峰。在《美国丽人》中,高潮是菲茨上校引诱莱斯特,还把他杀了。有时,三幕结构的高潮是主要角色的失败,但是从更深的层面看,主角永远不会彻底失败,因为他会在这个过程中学到一些重要的东西。莱斯特被枪杀(因此他失败了),但是他理解到,在表面风平浪静的市郊生活中,其实有着很多和他一样不快乐、受折磨的灵魂,而他自己的一生其实充满了美(因此他学到了一些重要的东西)。
《美国丽人》的“结局/尾声”部分独具匠心。情节中不确定的部分都交代清楚了,关于是谁杀死了莱斯特再也没有疑问。同样,主题也得到了明确的表达:莱斯特在弥留之际重新审视了他“愚蠢的小小人生”,并且发现,他苦苦寻求的“美”其实一直都在他琐碎的日常记忆里。从结构上来说,重新回放莱斯特居住过的市郊环境的俯视镜头也给电影带来一种轮回感,在结构上划上了完美的句号。


风格
*玫瑰在《美国丽人》中的象征意义
电影的题目“美国丽人”其实是一种攻瑰花的名字。很自然,电影中最重要的象征(或母题)就是玫瑰花瓣。玫瑰花瓣很明显与安吉拉有关 -- 或者更准确地说,与莱斯特对安吉拉的幻想有关。玫瑰花瓣第一次出现是莱斯特观看安吉拉在学校啦啦队演出的时候,莱斯特被安吉拉的美貌迷住了。他进入了幻觉,安吉拉好像在为他一个人表演;在表演结束时,她打开上衣,玫瑰花瓣倾泻而出。后来莱斯特又幻想安吉拉在泡满玫瑰花瓣的浴缸中洗澡,当他去亲吻她的时候,这一吻在莱斯特的嘴里留下了一片玫瑰花瓣。在西方文化传统中,玫瑰有一系列彼此联系的象征意义。最表面的意义,玫瑰代表热烈的爱情,男人把玫瑰作为礼物送给自己的情人就是这个原因。但是,作为浪漫情感的象征,玫瑰还有一种矛盾的意义。美丽的花朵和花瓣总是伴随着长着尖刺的茎-“玫瑰有刺”是句老话 -- 因此,玫瑰也代表危险的美,或者有某种不足。此外,玫瑰也以它短暂的花期著称,暗示着美丽(尤其是青春的美)也是转瞬即逝的。这种意义曾经开启及时行乐风格的诗,劝读者“抓住每一天”,在还有能力时尽情享受生命、爱情和美。17世纪英国诗人罗伯特·赫里克的诗句充分描写了玫瑰的这种意义:“玫瑰堪折直须折。”
安吉拉与这些玫瑰相联系,因此也与这些象征意义相联系:热烈的爱情、危险的后果、青春转瞬即逝的美丽。但是,我们应该注意到,莱斯特想象中的安吉拉总是和玫瑰花瓣有关,而不是玫瑰本身(玫瑰花瓣没有长刺的茎)。这也就向我们暗示,他对安吉拉的激情是片面的、不现实的。他没有接受全部的象征意义:玫瑰不仅有花瓣,还有刺。美国丽人这种玫瑰在美国文化史上有着特殊的意义。因为小约翰·D.洛克菲勒曾经用它来比喻社会达尔文主义,他认为只有强者才能够 -- 也应该 -- 存活下来。“大型公司的扩张不过是适者生存而已,”洛克菲勒给布朗大学基督教青年会作演讲时这样说,“美国丽人这种玫瑰之所以能够长得赏心悦目,花香四溢,正是因为我们把
早期多余的花剪掉了。在商业中也有这种行为,这并不是邪恶的做法,只不过是按大自然和上帝的规律办事而已。”美国丽人这种玫瑰,也象征着莱斯特和其他角色必须承受的残酷的竞争环境。

*镜头
《美国丽人》摄影的一个主要特点就是俯视镜头的频繁使用。在电影中,根据不同的使用方法,俯视镜头有两个作用。一种使用方法是从上方拍摄角色(尤其是莱斯特)躺在床上的情景,这种镜头的作用是强化电影展开的批判:美国市郊的生活沉闷,让人昏昏欲睡。
俯视镜头的另一种使用方法是创造一种效果,好像上帝在注视着莱斯特生活的那个市郊街区。事实上整部电影都是一个已经死了的人讲述他的回忆,因此俯视镜头也就是莱斯特在审视他过去的生活。这种视角鼓励观众从更加广泛的角度去看待电影中出现的事件,同时也产生莱斯特的生活可能在美国的市郊不断被重复着的想法。在莱斯特与布赖德和巴迪会面的时候,镜头的角度创造了重要的效果,莱斯特的镜头总是从高角度拍摄(莱斯特看起来弱小无力);而对方的镜头则是从比较低的角度拍摄(让他们看起来高大有力)。此外,这些场景中有时还使用广角镜头夸张视野,这让莱斯特看上去更渺小,与那些有权有势、能够欺侮他的人的差距也就更大了。
镜头的对称结构的使用可以增强角色所在的市郊生活一成不变的沉闷感。伯纳姆一家一起吃饭的时候,一切都安排得井然有序(卡罗林坐在左边,简坐在中间,莱斯特坐在右边);菲茨一家看电视的时候也遵守同样的对称原则(菲茨夫人坐在左边,菲茨上校坐在中间,里基·菲茨坐在右边)。通过使用“正面描绘”原则,电影故意制造了一种微妙的不自然感:所有的角色要么正对镜头,要么是侧脸(他们都不会斜对镜头)。

《美国丽人》:摄影技巧
“电影至少有三种不同的视觉效果。在主要部分,门德斯想要一种‘空旷的、几乎是超现实的风格 -- 明亮、清爽、有棱有角 -- 种马格里特般的风格来表现美国市郊’(马格里特是比利时超现实主义画家 -- 译者注)。为了加强这种风格他决定在布景上尽量简洁。‘有时候我觉得总美术设计师肯定想杀了我。我老是说:“把那个从墙上拿下来,把这个从街上弄走,让画面空一点,让画面空一点。”我总是让人把东西拿走。’门德斯和资深摄影师康拉德·霍尔合作,门德斯选择了‘一种非常沉静的摄影风格。我不想用固定支架。我不想用过多的特写。我认识到,我的镜头是要静止再静止,要一种神秘的感觉。’在莱斯特幻想的场面中,摄影机的运动比较‘平滑、优雅’,而在里基用摄像机拍摄的镜头中(其实这些镜头的大部分都是门德斯亲自拍摄的),则有一种‘手提带来的动感,充满奇异的力量,镜头中的影像有不同的诗意。’”


评论角度
*功能失常的美国
“功能失常”这个词的字面意思本来是受损害或不能正常发挥功能,但是,现在人们越来越多地用它来形容社会中人与人接触的不正常和不和谐。因此,我们可以把《美国丽人》中表现的美国称为“功能失常”。莱斯特和卡罗林虽然是夫妻,但是其实只是对方在寻找幸福的道路上的绊脚石,而且他们都与自己唯一的女儿简非常疏远。他们的邻居菲茨一家也是一样的功能失常:菲茨上校是一个自我压抑的同性恋,他对妻子的虐待使她精神已经不太正常,对儿子的虐待使里基一度进入精神病院。事实上,主要角色中有很多都有着明显的精神问题。
莱斯特·伯纳姆正处于典型的“中年危机”。心理学家埃里克·埃里克松对中年危机这个概念的解释最全面。他认为这是人类成长中(通常在中年出现)的一个阶段,这时一个人突然认识到青春已逝,而自己的成就和经历还远远不够。中年危机中的人们为了抓住已经失去的青春作出种种徒劳的努力,可能会离开自己多年的伴侣和职业。他可能会参加一些年轻人的活动、寻找新的经历、追求年轻的情人。埃里克松相信中年危机从某种程度上讲是无法避免的,但是也并不是无法克服的。人们可以通过培养“有用感”(愿意无条件为他人付出)来克服中年危机。中年危机的根本来源是对生命意义的迷茫,有用感则可以最好地帮助一个人找到新的生活目标,成为对社会有用的人。
另一方面,困扰菲茨上校的是他对自己同性恋倾向的抑制。抑制是弗洛伊德提出的概念,指的是意识无法面对真实的(但却是禁忌的)欲望,因此这些欲望被推进了无意识。但是,欲望并不会消失,相反,由于它们已经不受意识的控制,反而变得更加危险难测。对于菲茨上校来说,被抑制的同性恋倾向致使他虐待妻儿。此外,他把自己的同性恋倾向“投射”到其他人身上,误认为莱斯特是同性恋,甚至认为自己的儿子是一个同性恋卖淫者。
安吉拉、简和里基所面临的问题是成长阶段中的“身份危机”。这种危机通常在青少年中出现,青少年需要寻找自己的身份,并将这种身份融入社会。这个过程并不总是一帆风顺,需要青少年从老一辈中寻找自己的楷模 -- 值得尊敬、值得青少年学习的人。这个过程还包括一系列“成长仪式”,象征着进入成年,并且承担成年人的责任。在传统社会中,这一系列仪式包括一些象征性的难关(例如打猎)或者象征性的典礼;在现代社会中,这一系列“仪式”则包括中学毕业舞会、大学毕业典礼,甚至包括考取驾照。
安吉拉认为在世界上最糟糕的事莫过于“平凡”,这表明她极度渴望自己独特的身份。但是,在当代美国,这种独特性只能通过在媒体上出名实现(对她来说就是成为模特),而不是在所属的社会群体中找到自己固定的位置。里基和简在应对这个危机的时候比较成功:他们通过彼此相爱对自己的身份产生了新认识。他们用摄影机拍下的相互的影像就是这个过程的一部分 -- 通过别人的眼睛来认识自己。

*人类感情的媒介
电影的本质其实是观众在偷窥电影中所记录的角色的生活。但是,《美国丽人》是一部特殊的电影,因为它突出了电影摄像和观众的位置:这些在电影中不仅仅是一种技巧,而是成为了主题的一部分。用电影理论家马歇尔·麦克卢汉的话来说,传达信息的媒介本身变成了信息。这个问题主要是由里基和简的关系表现的。两个人的恋情开始于里基的“变态”行为 -- 他用摄像机拍摄简在自己家里的情形,这在理论上是侵犯了她的“隐私”。一开始简很恼火,她的朋友安吉拉也是。但是时间长了,她越来越欣赏和理解里基的个性和意图,开始积极地参与对自己生活的拍摄,并且(尤其是)通过摄影机来发展她和里基的恋情。电影在这里表现的是“感情的媒介”:使用某种媒介(在电影中是摄影机)来表达一个人对另外一个人的感情。
解释的方法有两种。一是现代美国社会已经习惯使用各种媒介(例如电话、照片、电视和英特网),人们已经无法直接、即时地表达自己的感情。有一场戏特别能够表现媒介让人们疏远 -- 里基在自己的房间里,拍摄正在照镜子的简。当时,这对恋人被很多的障碍分开:(1)摄像机的镜头;(2)里基房间的窗户;(3)简房间的窗户和(4)镜子。一层又一层的透明或者反射玻璃是简的影像的媒介,但它们也是实实在在的障碍。看上去就好像两个人在心理上无法进行直接的、“正常”的沟通,于是他们之间产生了距离。
另外-种解释则完全相反 -- 媒介是人类存在不可缺少的一部分,可以帮助促进人们之间的亲密友爱。简对里基的第一个真正的亲昵举动就是在窗前脱衣,里基站在对面的窗前拍摄。摄影机的距离让她对自己以及自己的身材更有信心;此外,也是因为这样,她和里基的关系更加纯洁。因为里基透过摄影机对她的观察并不是出于情欲,而是纯粹美学上的欣赏。加里·亨齐说过:“有了摄影机的帮助,莱斯特自卑的女儿简终于通过爱人的双眼看到了自己。这暗示若这种从美学的角度看世界的方法是和人类感情分不开的,而且可以帮助人们形成对自我的成熟认识。”

*美的概念
电影的题目已经指出了它的一个重要的主题:在当代美国社会中“美”的概念。事实上这里也引出了一系列其他的问题:“什么是美?”“美为什么重要?”以及“当我们放弃每天一成不变的生活来追求美时,会发生什么?”《美国丽人》中“美”的代言人是里基·菲茨;而莱斯特·伯纳姆则是他的追随者。里基·菲茨给简看的那一段他拍摄的录像最能说明他对美的理解。他相信,这是他最美的作品:一段十五分钟的录像里显示一个白色的塑料袋在墙角被风吹得上下飘动。奇怪的是,这段录像确实有一种无法否认的美。这个小小的塑料袋当然只是垃圾,它被风吹动时的运动没有规律、没有意义。但是,表面看起来无章可循的运动却暗示了更高层次规律的存在,这种规律能将塑料袋的飞扬转变成具有神秘吸引力的风景。

里基解释道,它美是因为它暗示着世间万物都有着某种“生命” -- 宇宙中有一种与人为善的力量。即使是(或者尤其是)那些最不被人珍惜、没有意义的东西背后,都有着一种神圣的力量。里基的摄影和摄像作品还包括尸体(动物和人的尸体)的图像。这种审美趣味似乎有点变态,但是里基有自己的解释。他说,在死亡中,有一刻你可以看到上帝在直视着你 -- 你也可以和他对视。你所看到的东西,就是“美”。也许里基想说的是这个意思:在死亡中,一个人可以看到上帝对人类的安排,同时也可以看到生命本身的伟大奇迹背后的原理。
因此,美有两种重要特点:第一,美无处不在,只要用心去看就会看到。美并不仅仅存在于卡罗林精心修饰的装扮,也不仅仅存在于安古拉这样的纯真少女的美貌。美是培养一种看事物和理解事物的方法。第二,美是把人和神(或者和上帝)连接在一起的力量。但是,这个“上帝”指的并不仅仅是基督教的上帝,它是控制着世间万物的一种善的力量,它会保证宇宙间任何东西,不管它看起来是多么渺小,都有自己的意义。

Comedy in the cinema can be dated right back to 1985 and the first screening given by the Lumière brothers of a short piece entitled "Watering the Gardener(《浇水园丁》)”(or L'Arroseur Arrose). Despite the simplicity of this early work-it depicted nothing more than a man with a watering hose who is tricked by a mischievous child into spray- ing himself- comedy was soon well on its way to becoming an entrenched(确立的,地位牢固的)part of the cinematic world. Early comedies were domi- nated by the "slapstick ([Fl)" form that gave rise to both the mimic genius of Charlie Chaplin and the deadpan(面无表情的)"stoneface" humour of Buster Keaton; with the advent of sound technology com- edy changed its form yet again, leaning this time towards more sophisticated forms of verbal humour, such as the absurdist(荒诞主义者)banter(戏谑,玩 笑)of the Marx Brothers,the double entendres(双 关语)of Mae West, and the caustic(讽刺的,挖苦的) fast-paced repartee(妙语,巧辩)and social satire of “screwball(古怪的人)"comedy. The genre has since diversified into a bewildering variety of forms, from the neurotic(神经质的)satire of Woody Allen's AnnieHall(《安妮·霍尔》)(1977)and the gentle humorousness of romantic comedies such as When Harry Met Sally(《当哈里遇到莎莉》)(1989) and Four Weddings and a Funera/(1993)to the scatological(有淫秽言语的)farce(笑剧,闹剧)of American Pie(《美国派》)(1999).
The history of comedy stretches back to the ancient Greeks, whose thinking and practice has been influential to this day. Aristotle famously defined comedy as a form of drama that deals in an amusing way with ordinary characters in everyday situations. Other ancient writers advanced this definition by observing that in comedy the characters are private individuals (as opposed to kings or statesmen) from the middle level in society, that the dangers they face are not serious, and that their actions conclude happily. Comedy differs from tragedy in that it shows a basically positive attitude to life; life is not to be fled from or rejected, but to be grasped and enjoyed for what it is.
Comedy - whether in its Greek, Shakespearean or Hollywood forms -tends to be concerned with the concept of renewal in its broadest sense. Northrop Frye once argued that comedy and tragedy were both parts of a mythic cycle, with comedy representing the victory of spring over winter. In this sense, tragedy can be consid- ered an uncompleted comedy in which spring is never reached; comedy, conversely, represents the completion of a cycle that must contain within itself the possibility of tragedy. Helen Gardner takes a similar perspective when she suggests that comedy is "an image of the flow of human life" and the process of renewal and rebirth. It is for this reason, she suggests, that marriage and procreation (#) are never very far from the comic genre:"The young wed(结婚<主要用于文学作品或新闻作品中>),so that they may become in turn the older generation, whose children will wed, and so on, as long as the world lasts."1 Comedy's attitude towards marriage is broadly positive, and yet not unconditionally so; there is no place in this genre for the unhappy, loveless and passionless marriage.
At the heart of much comedy lies the figure of the fool, whether in the shape of Charlie Chaplin, Forrest Gump, or even Mr. Bean. Yet the comic fool is never simply a fool; he is also the source of an unusual perceptiveness and wisdom from which the ordinary man is alienated. The comic fool may be a wisefool, who sees that in an insane world all but the fools are insane; or he may be a holy fool, who is blessed by his simplicity to spread love and work wonders. Either way, the fool of comedy can lead the viewer towards new and unusual perspectives and insights towards reality -insights that our sensible, logical and rational selves seem unable to achieve. 
喜剧片
喜剧电影的出现可以追溯到1895年,吕米埃尔兄弟首次放映了一个叫做《浇水 园丁》的短片。短片表现了一个顽皮的儿童作弄拿着水管的园丁,让园丁把水浇到了 自己身上。虽然这部早期作品情节简单,但是很快,喜剧片就在电影世界中自成一家。 闹剧片占据了早期喜剧电影的主流。闹剧片成就了查理·卓别林的模仿天才,以及冷 面笑星巴斯特·基顿的冷幽默风格。随着声音技术的出现,喜剧片的形式摇身一变, 这一次是向着形式更为复杂、使用语言幽默的方向发展。例如马克斯兄弟的荒诞搞笑 和梅·韦斯特的双关妙语,语速极快、暗带讽刺的搞笑对白以及讽刺社会现象的“神 经喜剧”。这一类型进一步发展出了各种驳杂的形式,从伍迪·艾伦神经兮兮的讽刺 片《安妮·霍尔》(1977)、温和的浪漫轻喜剧《当哈里遇到莎莉》(1989)及《四个 婚礼和一个葬礼》(1993)到《美国派》(1999)这类的俚俗喜剧片。
喜剧的历史可以追溯到古希腊时代,当时的思想和行为对今天仍有影响。亚里士 多德有一个关于喜剧的著名定义:喜剧是用幽默的手段表现日常生活中的小人物的一 种戏剧形式。其他古代作家进一步发展了这个定义,他们指出喜剧中的人物是一些平 民个体(而不是王公大臣),来自社会的中层。这些人物遇到的危险不是十分严峻的, 他们的行动也常常以幸福快乐收尾。喜剧和悲剧的区别在于它展现了对生活的一种基本的积极态度;人们不应该逃避或抗拒生活,而是应该抓住生活、享受生活。
喜剧 --- 不管是在古希腊、在莎士比亚的作品中,还是好莱坞电影里––在最广 泛的意义上都和循环往复、生生不息这个概念相联系。诺斯罗普·弗赖伊曾经论证, 喜剧和悲剧都是一个神话循环的一部分,喜剧代表春天战胜了冬天。同样,悲剧则是 没有等来春天的、没有完结的喜剧。喜剧代表的是一个完结了的循环,而这个循环本 身也必须包含悲剧的可能性。海伦·加德纳的观点与之相似,她认为**喜剧“是人类生命洪流的缩影”,是周而复始的生命过程的象征**。因此,她认为喜剧片总是离不开婚 姻和生育:“年轻人结婚,然后他们上了年纪,他们的孩子又会结婚,不断循环往复, 除非世界终结。”喜剧对待婚姻的态度总体上是积极的,但也不是毫无条件的积极。在这个类型的影片中,那种缺乏爱情和激情、不快乐的婚姻是没有立足之地的。
很多喜剧片都是围绕着“愚者”这个核心角色,愚者可能以查理·卓别林、阿甘, 甚至憨豆先生的形象出现。但是,**喜剧的愚者不仅仅是一个傻瓜,他代表了一种普通人不能理解的人生智慧和洞察力。喜剧的愚者可能是大智若愚的愚贤,因为他看到在这个疯狂的世界中只有愚者不是疯狂的;他也可能是一个愚圣,因为简单的头脑是 一种天赋,让他可以传播爱,创造奇迹。不管是哪一种,喜剧的愚者可以让观众用 不同寻常的视角和观点去发现真相和真理,这种真理是讲逻辑、有理智的聪明人无 法发现的。**
探讨喜剧,不能不提到幽默,也不能不问这个基本的问题 -- 是什么让我们发笑?哲学家、心理学家和文学家都为了寻找这个问题的答案冥思苦想。解释幽默的理论主要有三种:幽默是轻视、幽默是释放、幽默是不和谐
● 幽默是轻视 幽默是轻视的理论来源于古希腊和罗马。这种想法的基础是:我们看到其他人软弱和愚蠢的样子会发笑。幽默给我们机会表达优越感和攻击性,让我们感到愉快。英国哲学家托马斯·霍布斯说,幽默不过是把我们自己和他人比较产生的优越感,从而带来“意外的荣耀感”。
● 幽默是释放 这种幽默理论认为幽默和欢笑可以帮助我们释放社会规则和约束所带来的压力。例如,弗洛伊德就曾强调玩笑是用社会允许的方法来表达社会不允许的欲望(通常是和性欲或攻击性有关);幽默其实是给反社会的真实心理罩上了一层“烟幕”。因此,我们会笑,是因为看别人打破了社会规则或者看到了隐藏的反社会欲望的释放 -- 这是我们(或多或少)都有的一种欲望。
● 幽默是不和谐 幽默是对于不和谐的欣赏的理论比较现代,是当今关于幽默的心理学思想的主流。根据这种理论,我们会笑是因为看到了不和谐的东西。这一理论的学者认为,能够想象并且欣赏这种不和谐的能力 -- 也就是一种能够从不同寻常、不可预测、不切实际的角度去看世界的能力 -- 从本质上来说是对人类有益的。这种能力打开我们的思维,让我们看到新的可能性,也因此推动了科学和艺术的前进。
《阿甘正传》(1994)
《阿甘正传》是当代电影中最受欢迎,也最具争议的电影之一。电影改编自温斯顿·格鲁姆的同名小说,埃里克·罗思改编,罗伯特 ·泽梅基斯导演。在上映的前五十天中就获得了两千万美元的票房,并且获得了六项奥斯卡奖(包括最佳电影、最佳导演和最佳男主角)。在电影大获成功后小说的平装本也再次出版,在第一年销量就从三万册激增到了一百五十万册。趁热出炉的《阿甘妙语录》(总结阿甘说过的名言的小册子)也风靡一时,竟让阿甘获得了孔子、奥里利乌斯、尼采同等的地位。(例如:“不说话是永远不会招麻烦的。”“胡说八道是一件事,相信胡说八道是另外一件事。”“大部分人看上去都不傻,直到他们开始张嘴说话。”)阿甘独特的文化意义也体现在随电影产生的一系列新词汇上,人们在“阿甘”这个概念的基础上创造了种种形容词(“阿甘式”)、动词(“阿甘化”)和抽象名词(“阿甘主义”)。
虽然观众很爱这部电影,评论界的评价却褒贬不一。电影中表现的当代历史深深触及了美国人的内心,揭开了一些旧疮疤,因此对此片的评论可谓两极分化。对于一些人来说,阿甘是自由美国的英雄,他智力残疾、来自单亲母亲的家庭、和不幸的黑人青年成为了挚友 -- 他有一种“先天的善良和后天的反种族歧视立场”。另外一些人 -- 包括著名的共和党人纽特·金里奇和帕特·布坎南 -- 意见则完全不同:《阿甘正传》是一部保守的电影,认为传统家庭观念和爱国主义要优于反文化运动的“进步”力量。评论界越来越多地认为这部电影是对美国历史进行欺骗性的改写,以便减轻美国中产阶级白人男性对美国政治错误的内疚感,比如对种族隔离制度、越南战争和性剥削的负罪感。《阿甘正传》引发了关于国家认同的一场激烈的辩论,以至于这部电影被称为“美国现实的寓言”。
唯一无可争辩的是,这部电影是一部不同凡响、匠心独运的杰作。电影在喜剧框架中穿插了一些个人悲剧的片断,因为电影整体的基调是幽默欢快的,这些片段也就更加有感染力。阿甘这个可爱的角色 -- 他的原型是大智若愚的愚贤 -- 和他所爱的角色珍妮交织着发展。通过阿甘和爱人迥异而又相联系的故事,观众可以理解电影的核心道德观:简单的哲学、理想化的美国和对美国历史充满乐观精神的重现。
故事梗概
电影讲述的是阿甘 -- 一个智商只有75的友善的傻子的故事。他在毫不自觉的 情况下,懵懵懂懂地卷入了美国现代历史中很多重要事件。 阿甘生于20世纪50年代的一个美国小镇,他爱上了镇上的姑娘珍妮。珍妮对他 很好,同情他智力上的障碍。有一天,阿甘在珍妮的鼓励下奋勇地逃脱了当地小孩的 欺负,并发现了自己的跑步天分。凭着这个天分阿甘进了大学,还成了大学里的橄榄 球明星。毕业时,阿甘应征入伍,参加了越战。在军队里,阿甘与黑人战友布巴结成了好友,他们共同在丹中尉的指挥下作战。在一次任务中,他们受到伏击,布巴受了, 伤。阿甘赶来相救,布巴却还是死在了阿甘的怀抱里。丹中尉虽然得救了,但是由于 受伤过重,双腿被截肢。丹中尉怨恨阿甘,因为如果阿甘没有救他,他就不用瘸着双 腿苟活于世。
另一方面,阿甘的际遇则是高潮迭起。他在军队医院里学会了打乒乓球,由于球 技惊人,被选拔到美国队,代表美国参加和中国的乒乓球比赛。阿甘用打乒乓球赚到 的钱开了一个捕虾公司,后来丹中尉与阿甘和好,也来公司帮忙。就在这时,其他捕 虾业的竞争公司一个接一个地沉船,阿甘的公司则如有神助,大获全胜。此后,阿甘 又非常幸运地把钱投资到了苹果电脑公司,最后成为了一个有钱人。
珍妮回到了小镇,但是却不愿意嫁给阿甘。阿甘伤心之下,开始横穿整个美国进 行长跑。他的壮举带动了沿途的人,越来越多的人开始跟着他跨美长跑。当他回来时, 发现珍妮给他生了一个孩子,但是她自己却染上艾滋病,时日无多。珍妮死后,阿甘 在墓前悼念她。电影的结尾,阿甘送小阿甘坐上自己多年以前坐过的那辆校车,形成 了一个完整的循环。
类型
《阿甘正传》是一部喜剧片,因为它符合几乎所有喜剧片这一类型的标准:它轻松搞笑,讲述的是普通人物的日常生活,结尾皆大欢喜,对待人生的态度也基本上是 积极的。此外,从最广义的角度来看,这是一部关于万象更新的电影:虽然电影中有 一些悲剧性的时刻(例如布巴、阿甘妈妈和珍妮的死),但它最终表现的是爱的胜利(通过阿甘和珍妮的和解表现出来)和生命的胜利(通过阿甘的儿子表现出来)。毫无疑问,没有人比阿甘这个形象更能出色地表现一个拥有智慧、有如圣徒般的傻瓜(他的智慧体现在他比任何人更懂得生命的本质就是爱;他的圣徒气质来自神的赐福。)
不用说,《阿甘正传》是一部非常好笑的电影 -- 但是我们应该如何解释它的幽默呢?有一种方法就是用“幽默是不和谐”的理论来解释。不协调的幽默指的是我们看到一些不协调或不适宜的东西时会感到好笑。这种幽默让我们能从一些新颖、特别、也更有创造性的角度去看这个世界。在《阿甘正传》中两个著名的场景就使用了不协调的幽默。第一个场景是已经失去双腿的丹中尉见到阿甘,提醒阿甘现在的自己和以前的自己有所不同:“我曾经是丹·泰勒中尉。”观众明白,丹中尉的遭遇改变了他的个性,在他眼中的自己已经不是同一个人了。但是头脑简单的阿甘却没听懂,说道:“你还是丹中尉啊。”这就产生了一种不协调,因为阿甘应该能够理解丹中尉的意思。富有讽刺意味的是,阿甘的看法其实要更高一筹:虽然身有残疾,但是丹中尉确实仍然是丹中尉,而在影片的最后丹中尉终于认识到了这一点。
另外一个场景就是阿甘在珍妮墓前说的那段话。他说:“我不知道我们的生活到底是命里早已注定的,还是纯粹出于机缘巧合,在风里漂泊不定。也许二者都是,也许二者同时都在发生。”阿甘说的是两个原本完全不能相容的可能性 -- 决定人们生活的要么是命运,要么是偶然。但阿甘不合逻辑地作出结论说命运和偶然都在起作用。阿甘认定两个相互矛盾的假设都是正确的,这就是一种不和谐,产生幽默的效果。但是,这个不和谐却能给观众新的启示:也许,我们那种严谨、符合逻辑的思想方法在某些方面是有局限性的,而正是阿甘这种不符合逻辑的独特视角更能反映我们的生活。

《阿甘正传》这部电影的成功很大程度上要归功于阿甘这个具有神秘魅力的主人公。阿甘是一个很好的范例,向我们展现了好莱坞如何让观众对主人公产生兴趣-这是必不可少的一项工作。
观众和主人公取得认同的第一步,就是“认识”这个角色 -- 把虚构的人物当成一个真正的人。要完成这一步骤,一个重要的方法就是使用人们熟悉的角色类型 --或者,在《阿甘正传》中,是使用原型。《阿甘正传》中的原型就是“愚贤”(或者“智慧的白痴”)。这种原型就是智力有障碍,但是却有着特殊天赋能力的人。温斯顿·格鲁姆的原著小说《阿甘正传》中,阿甘对自己的智力障碍的特性有所认识(“我脑子里的东西好像和其他人的不太一样”),并且把自己和一些文学作品中著名的白痴相比较,例如陀思妥耶夫斯基的《白痴》和莎士比亚的《李尔王》中的傻子(“因为这些白痴总是比大家想的要聪明”)。使用这种原型可以帮助观众认识虚构世界中的主人公,把他当成一个可信的角色。
第二个阶段是“认可”,即观众开始从某一个角色的角度来看故事。在《阿甘正传》中,认可是通过使用第一人称的叙述,这样观众看到的故事和阿甘的经历是完全一致的。观众不可能和其他角色取得认同:布巴死得太早,丹中尉出现得太晚,珍妮则大部分都是在“幕后”。除此之外唯一的视角就是观众自己的视角(见“戏剧性讽刺”)。
最后一个阶段是“认定”。在这个阶段中,观众对角色的吸引力做出评价,并且决定角色在多大程度上值得自己同情和支持。关于为什么《阿甘正传》是一部吸引人的作品,导演非常清楚:**“因为阿甘的空白,”泽梅基斯说道,“每个人都可以有自己的理解。”导演让阿甘这个角色保持“空白”,因而观众可以随意理解和解释角色。因为阿甘是空白的,所以任何人都可以对他做出任何理解 -- 怀有不同信念的观众可以畅通无阻地对阿甘进行“认定”。**
阿甘和其他角色形成的反差进一步促进了我们和阿甘取得认同,因为在这些反差中电影总是比较倾向于阿甘。阿甘和珍妮的对照首先出现在他们两小无猜的场景:“珍妮教我爬树,我教她怎么吊在树上。珍妮教我认字,我教她玩荡秋千。”这种对比贯穿了整个影片。阿甘倚赖直觉,珍妮倚赖理智;阿甘被动,珍妮主动;阿甘保守,珍妮激进;阿甘以家庭为中心,珍妮则以自我为中心;阿甘是创造性的,而珍妮是毁灭性的。最终,叙述赞同的是阿甘,而不是珍妮。
丹中尉也和阿甘存在着鲜明的反差。丹中尉总是力求给事件找到合乎逻辑的解释,这与阿甘的性格大相径庭。他总是依赖因果关系进行思考:既然阿甘是一个傻子,他就不可能在捕虾业中成功。根据同样的逻辑,既然丹中尉失去了双腿,他就是一个毫无用处的乞丐。但是,在电影中,恰恰是这种思想方法阻碍了丹中尉的发展。倒是阿甘的愚钝让他拒绝从因果关系的角度来看问题,从而使丹中尉摆脱了自我毁灭的行为。看到阿甘虽然有智力障碍,却仍然能够按照自己的意愿生活,丹中尉也最终忘记了自身的残疾,继续自己的人生。
归根结底,阿甘的吸引力来自于他超越平凡的能力 -- 这是因为他能够超越理智的局限。他能够充分欣赏“存在”的美好,从来不因为一些不必要的问题而庸人自扰。他惊叹越南有着各种各样的雨,却不曾用起因和结果来困扰自己。他能够欣赏在电影一开始悠然下落的羽毛,却不会问它从哪来,它的意义是什么?阿甘总能简单地、直觉地从情感上切入事物的真相。就像他对珍妮说的那样:“我的脑袋不好使,但我知道爱是什么。”而珍妮却一直无法理解爱的真谛,虽然她才华横溢、充满好奇(也许这正是珍妮无法理解的原因)。

叙述

章回式结构和循环
《阿甘正传》的结构基本上来说是松散的,即电影由主人公人生中出现的单个、松散的事件组成。贯穿整个叙述的不是情节,而是阿甘这个人物本身。除了松散的结构,电影还有着多处的循环。阿甘受家乡男孩欺负的场景,后来再次出现。珍妮著名的台词“快跑!阿甘,快跑!”也曾重复。阿甘乘坐校车的时候没有人愿意与他同坐,在他随军向越南出发时这一场景再次出现。阿甘一次又一次地被美国总统接见,电视则报道着美国现代历史中一个又一个重要人物被刺。最深刻的循环就是小阿甘的出生以及他坐上校车的场景。这次虽然是重复,但却是在向好的方向前进:小阿甘有着与父亲相似的魅力,但却没有智力上的障碍。所有这些重复创造了一个大的循环:历史在不断重演,如果这种重演中有所变化的话(如小阿甘的智力超过其父),也一定是朝着好的方向。

* 故事、情节和次要情节
故事是整个电影直接向观众表现的事件以及间接暗示的事件,它们按照时间顺序排列。情节只包括电影中直接表现的事件,而且这些事件可能按照、也可能不按照时间顺序来展现(见第三章)。通常,二者之间有明确的区别,观众必须使用电影中提供的信息补充成完整的故事。
但是,《阿甘正传》这部电影十分独特,因为阿甘一生的故事和电影的情节几乎是完全一样的。也就是说,电影的主要情节就是阿甘的人生故事。阿甘出生、上学、上大学、去越南、回家、建立捕虾公司、与珍妮重会、跨美长跑等等。情节并没有给我们留下想象的余地,阿甘一生中的每个重要事件都作为电影情节的一部分,一览无余。这形成了透明的叙述效果,对观众来说,阿甘的一生没有任何不确定的内容,没有任何隐藏的东西。
相反,电影的次要情节(主要是关于珍妮的一生)则完全相反:我们靠零零散散的线索拼凑起珍妮的人生。我们推断珍妮受到了父亲的性骚扰、我们推断她的母亲可能去世或是离开了、我们推断珍妮得了艾滋病(由于吸毒或滥交),但是这些信息都没有在次要情节中直接表现出来。这就造成了相反的效果:珍妮的人生中似乎充满了黑暗和隐藏的秘密,与阿甘形成了鲜明的对照。
* 视点和戏剧性反讽
电影的视角就是阿甘自己。但是电影的很多趣味和幽默都来源于戏剧性反讽的使用。戏剧性反讽指的是观众可以理解一段对话或一个事件的涵义,而剧中人物却不能理解。
《阿甘正传》中很多地方都使用了戏剧性讽刺。有时反讽仅是为了取得幽默的效果,比如阿甘在越南中了枪,他自己的陈述是:“好像有东西跳起来咬了我一口。”通常在阿甘的行为影响美国历史进程的时候,电影都会使用反讽。例如阿甘看到水门大厦有人侵入因而报警,引起水门事件而导致尼克松辞职。有时候反讽是一种黑色幽默,比如,阿甘说珍妮的父亲是一个非常慈爱的人,“因为他总是抚摸她和她的妹妹们”。阿甘还认为整个越南战争就是在寻找一个名叫“查理”的人。
在每次使用反讽的时候,观众都能够明白真正的情况,而幸福的阿甘却总是懵懂未觉。观众知道珍妮的父亲对她们的抚摸不是慈爱而是性侵犯,也知道“查理”不是一个人而是越战中美军对越共的统称。戏剧性反讽的效果就是让观众既能通过阿甘纯洁天真的双眼去看这些事件,同时又能够保持自己的理解。

##### TEXT

The "blockbuster" was born on 20 June 1975 with the release of Jaws. "Everything changed forever," noted the Paramount second-in-command. "Suddenly the studios were trying to make something that had never been known before -the summer blockbuster."1 With a simple underlying concept, an emphasis on spectacular action sequences and effects, and a wall-to-wall(普遍的,包括所有地区的) summer national release, Jaws broke all box-office records and changed Hollywood. Since then, the blockbuster has become a staple feature of Hollywood and the formula employed for its most commercially successful films, including Top Gun, Jurassic Park,Independence Day, Titanic(1997), Gladiator(2000), and Pearl Harbour.

The blockbuster has developed according to a strict economic logic. Its emphasis on spectacle has been a central component in the major studios' post-war strategy to regain audiences lost to television and other leisure activities - the idea being that narrative can be transferred to the small screen of television, whereas spectacle is only really effective when seen on the big screen in the film theatre itself. In addition, the spectacular quality of the blockbuster has also been commercially exploitable on other multimedia platforms, from computer games to theme park rides. A final advantage of spectacle, from the industrial point of view, was its translatability across cultures and language groups-an attractive quality given the increasing significance of overseas markets.

The concept of the blockbuster is inextricably(解不开的)tied to that of "high-concept" cinema. The idea of "high concept" is normally attributed to Hollywood hotshot(艺高胆大之人, 鬼才)and bad boy Don Simpson who crafted a "Corporate Philosophy" paper for Paramount in 1979/1980. Observing that Hollywood's primary aim was always to make money, he added that in order to make money "it may be necessary to make history [ ... ] it may be important to make art [ ... ] it may be important to win the Academy Award." But the crux was that every successful film had to be entertaining, and, according to Simpson, entertaining films were always driven by a concept. "A powerful idea is the heart of any successful film. The creative premise is what first attracts people to the product ... A good idea is one that seems imaginative, original, and in some way new and unique. The power of the biggest blockbuster films is that they come from out of nowhere and break new ground." One of Simpson's colleagues would later summarize it this way, "In the dizzying (% 69) world of filmmaking, we must not be distracted from one fundamental concept: The idea is king." The "concept", it must be added, did not need to be tremendously complicated: The idea behind Jaws was "shark attack", Alien was "Jaws in a spaceship", and Top Gun was "two guys in leather jackets and sunglasses standing in front of the biggest, fastest fucking airplane you ever saw in your life".

Although there can be little doubt that blockbusters constitute a definite category of film, there remains a certain amount of critical debate about whether the blockbuster is a genre as such. In fact, one of the difficulties of conceptualizing the blockbuster as a genre is that blockbusters tend to play fast and loose with all the other existing genres, and commonly emerge as hybrid forms such as "science fiction action adventure" or "romantic-historical epic". With respect to characterization, blockbusters typically present a strong central character with whom it is easy to identify and then put him up against a life-or-death challenge. As Simpson said, "the central character, before triumphing -and he had to triumph-must first be reduced, psychologically, and almost destroyed, before the comeback."5 Within this framework, the blockbuster is structured around "loosely linked, self-contained action sequences often built around spectacular stunts, stars, and special effects" with characters occupying certain predetermined and psychologically uncomplicated character roles or "functions". Simple and formulaic, maybe- but the block-
buster has become the most commercially successful product in the history of film.

##### The Matrix (1999)

The Matrix, written and directed by Andy and Larry Wachowski, is a phenomenon every bit as much as it is a film. Like other hit films, it has won awards (including four Oscars) and made money ($27 million in its first weekend), but on top of that it has also become something of a cultural and commercial event. There are now two sequels (Matrix Reloaded(《骇客帝国:重装上阵》) and Matrix Revolutions(《骇客帝国:矩阵革命》),two soundtrack CDs, a videocassette, a video game, two DVDs, and a range of other merchandising, tie-in, and franchise(特权,特许)deals(sunglasses, mobile phones, and comic books). On a higher level, The Matrix has inspired the Japanese-style anime of Animatrix (a series of shorts based loosely on the original film) and works of philosophy exploring its postmodern attitudes and religious motifs; even respected philosophers and scientists can be found probing the subtleties of the film on the official website, whatisthematrix.com. More worryingly, a number of recent killings in the US have been carried out by disturbed individuals who believe- or claim to believe-themselves living in the simulated world depicted in the film.

The Wachowski brothers had always been interested in films, comic books, and Japanese animation , and The Matrix was an attempt to combine the aesthetics of the three forms. But, more importantly, it was also an attempt to combine breathtaking action with intellectual content. As Larry Wachowski says, "We were determined to put as many ideas into the film as we could, and purposefully set out to try to put images up on the screen that people haven't ever seen before." Many in Hollywood failed to grasp the Wachowski brothers' vision, and the script lay unused for years. "Hardly anybody in town understood it. It became almost a running joke. People thought it was too complicated and too dense." Once the Hollywood bosses had been persuaded, the brothers turned to cinematographer (影摄影师)Bill Pope and Hong Kong director/stunt chore-ographer(武术指导)Yuen Woo Ping to realize their vision. Pope was responsible for the high-contrast light effects, which lend an aura of stylization to the film; Yuen Woo Ping drew on his experience of martial arts cinema and his mastery of wire-harness stunt work for the fight scenes.

The Wachowski brothers were impressed, and not just by his technical ability, "Hong Kong action directors actually bring narrative arcs into the fights, and tell a little story within the fighting." The Matrix is a blockbuster par excellence ( r, #fr), employing all the key features of the mode - a compelling basic premise, an emphasis on spectacle over narrative or psychological complexity, breathtaking special effects, and a strong central character with whom it is easy to identify. Indeed, the Wachowski brothers take the logic of the blockbuster "high-concept" formula to its limits, basing its plot and action on a single intriguing (if unoriginal) premise-that reality is an illusion-which succeeds not merely on account of its simplicity but also because it offers the basis for a coherent worldview. To this The Matrix adds a postmodern style that is eclectic(折衷的,从不同来源选辑或组成的)and playfully suggestive. The result is a film that at once satisfies the sensory demand for stimulation, and the intellectual demand for the possibility of something deeper.

##### Synopsis(故事梗概)

Keanu Reeves plays Thomas Anderson, a computer programmer for a large corporation by day, but by night a hacker who surfs the alternative world of the Internet under the alias(别名,化名) of “Neo”.His growing suspicion that something is not quite right about his existence is confirmed when he is approached by Trinity, an attractive female computer hacker, who seems to know all about his inner doubts. At the same time, the "authorities" have become aware that he poses a threat to them, and interrogate him in order to find out what he knows about the mysterious "Morpheus"- the leader of a band of rebels who operate in cyberspace.

The rebels approach Anderson and take him to Morpheus, who offers him a stark (苛刻的)choice: return to the familiar world of twentieth century America and carry on as before, or learn the reality of human existence. Anderson chooses the latter, but the reality he discovers is shocking. He is, in fact, living in a post-apocalypse twenty-second century world in which artificial intelligence (AI) has taken over; a war between humans and AI has blackened the sky and left the earth in a state of permanent winter. The one remaining human settlement (Zion) is buried close to the earth's core where it is still warm. This settlement is under constant attack by the AI.

Since there is no longer any sunlight, the AI can no longer use solar power as an energy source. Instead, human beings are being used as "batteries" to power the machines. They are"grown" and inserted into special pods that allow the electricity produced by their bodies to be channeled off and fed to the machines. To keep them in a state of passivity their brains are wired up to "the Matrix" of the title, a computer-generated fantasy world that feeds their minds the illusion that they are living in the twentieth century.

Morpheus is in charge of a ship, the "Nebuchadnezzar", and has been given the task of releasing certain predetermined human beings from their slavery. To do this, Morpheus and his rebels must themselves hack into the Matrix and "awaken" these individuals from their virtual existence. Thomas Anderson (Neo) is a rather special case: Morpheus believes that he is "the One" with special powers to manipulate the rules of the Matrix and liberate mankind.

With the help of his assistant, Trinity, Morpheus liberates Anderson and prepares him for his future role as Neo, the saviour of mankind. He is taught the rules of the Matrix and how to manipulate them, and taken for a meeting with the "Oracle" (an old woman who has the power to predict the future). The Oracle suggests, contrary to what Morpheus believes, that Neo is not "the One"; he is just an ordinary human being. She also tells him that he will face a choice: either let Morpheus die, or die himself.

Morpheus is caught by the "agents",sentient(有感觉力的,有知觉力的)beings controlled by the AI whose aim is to police the illusory world of the Matrix and to prevent human beings from becoming aware of the reality of their enslavement. The agents interrogate and torture Morpheus, and Neo decides to risk his life to save his mentor.

Neo frees Morpheus, but is trapped in the Matrix and confronted by Agent Smith, the most powerful and ruthless of the agents. Agent Smith kills Neo, but Neo returns to life (confirming that he is indeed "the One") and defeats Smith. Neo makes one final phone call to the AI who control the Matrix, informing them that a new age, in which humans will regain control of the earth, is drawing near. 

##### Genre

The Matrix displays all the usual features of the blockbuster: a high-concept premise that reality is a computer-generated illusion, a tendency towards spectacle and stylized presentation, a generic hybridity, a protagonist designed to promote audience identification, a general reduction of psychological complexity in favour of functionality, and a corresponding array of spin-off products including sequels, the anime version, and other forms of merchandise.

The essence of The Matrix as a blockbuster lies in the pure visual pleasure of its spectacle. The opening scene is an exemplary(典范的,作为例证的)moment. Surrounded by cops in a hotel room and about to be handcuffed, Trinity reaches out, takes hold of the cop's arm and breaks it before hitting him in the face with the palm of her hand. She then leaps up in preparation for the mid-air kick that will finish him off. Close to the apex of her leap, the Wachowski brothers employ their "bullet-time" (ultra-slow motion) technology to slow the action down to a point at which time is almost - but not quite -suspended; then, using the revolutionary "flow motion" technique, the camera circles the exquisitely poised woman as she hovers in mid-air. When the camera has completed its circular motion, Trinity and her assailant are suddenly returned to real-time and with a swift kick she disposes of the cop. Trinity drops back to earth and immediately kicks the chair in front of her into one of the cops, runs up and around the walls of the room as the two remaining cops,stunned(呆的,瞠目结舌的),unload their weapons,before dispensing with(除掉) them too. It is a stunningly beautiful scene, combining acrobatic poise and stylized violence; our usual narrative demands are suspended in the face of pure spectacle.

As is typical of the blockbuster, The Matrix freely combines traditional genres: It is a composite formation of action, science fiction, and martial arts. From action, The Matrix draws its set-piece action sequences; from science fiction, its imaginative presentation of a potential future for mankind; and from martial arts, the stylization of its fight scenes. Even within these generic categories, The Matrix is eclectic: The martial arts scenes casually mix Northern Leg and Southern Fist fighting styles with the more stylized gestures derived from Peking Opera. And, when viewed as the first installment of a trilogy that also includes Matrix Reloaded and Matrix Revolutions, the film is subordinated to a larger epic narrative that is concerned with the future of the human race as a whole.
